Using this demonstration

Type on your physical keyboard and see the on-screen keyboard show which keypresses are recognized.

Using the demo, you can see if there are certain key combinations that do not work correctly with your keyboard.
How to hunt for ghosts

Ghosts can be somewhat elusive.  Just because you find some combination of 6 keys that reports correctly does not necessarily mean that every combination of 6 works.  In fact, the most straightforward keyboard design has thousands of 3-key combinations that do not work! That is a lot, but it is still less than 5% of the total number of 3-key combinations.

A quick way to find problematic combinations is to press and hold A S D W (the most popular keys for moving around in games), and then, while holding those down, press every other key in turn.  If you find a key that does not work, try releasing some of the A S D W keys.  Odds are high that you will find a three-key combination that fails.

If you have an application that uses other combinations of keys, be sure to try those too!
Limitations

Some keys cannot be captured.  Notably, on Windows browsers generally cannot detect when the Print Screen key is pressed.

Certain keys will take the input focus away from the web page.  For example, pressing the Windows key will give focus to the Start menu.  To continue using the demo, move the focus back to the web page by clicking on the demo window.

This demo was developed and tested using a standard full-sized U.S. keyboard and major Windows-based browsers.  The key names and layout may not match your system, but the the ghosting behavior will still be evident.
