LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our primary cash requirements stem from the payment of transfer fees for the acquisition of players’ registrations, capital expenditures for the improvement of facilities at Old Trafford and the Carrington training ground (“Carrington”), payment of interest on our borrowings, employee benefit expenses, other operating expenses and dividends on our Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares. Historically, we have met these cash requirements through a combination of operating cash flow and proceeds from the transfer fees from the sale of players’ registrations. Our existing borrowings primarily consist of our secured term loan facility, our senior secured notes and outstanding drawdowns under our revolving facilities. We manage our cash flow interest rate risk where appropriate using interest rate swaps. Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting a portion of variable rate borrowings from floating to fixed rates. We have US dollar borrowings that we use to hedge our US dollar commercial revenue exposure. We continue to evaluate our financing options and may, from time to time, take advantage of opportunities to repurchase or refinance all or a portion of our existing indebtedness to the extent such opportunities arise. As of 31 December 2022, we had cash resources of £31.0 million and all funds are held as cash and cash equivalents and therefore available on demand. As of 31 December 2022, we also had access to an undrawn revolving facility of £100 million. However, we cannot assure you that our cash generated from operations, cash and cash equivalents or cash available under our revolving facilities will be sufficient to meet our long-term future needs. We cannot assure you that we could obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all, including as a result of changes or volatility in the credit or capital markets, which affect our ability to borrow money or raise capital.
Our business ordinarily generates a significant amount of cash from our Matchday revenues and commercial contractual arrangements at or near the beginning of our fiscal year, with a steady flow of other cash received throughout the fiscal year. In addition, we ordinarily generate a significant amount of our cash through advance receipts, including season tickets (which include general admission season tickets and seasonal hospitality tickets), most of which are received prior to the end of June for the following season. Our Broadcasting revenue from the Premier League and UEFA are paid periodically throughout the season, with primary payments made in late summer, December, January and the end of the football season. Our sponsorship and other commercial revenue tends to be paid either quarterly or annually in advance. However, while we typically have a high cash balance at the beginning of each fiscal year, this is largely attributable to deferred revenue, the majority of which falls under current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, and this deferred revenue is unwound through the statement of profit or loss over the course of the fiscal year. Over the course of a year, we use our cash on hand to pay employee benefit expenses, other operating expenses, interest payments and other liabilities as they become due. This typically results in negative working capital movement at certain times during the year. In the event it ever became necessary to access additional operating cash, we also have access to cash through our revolving facilities. As of 31 December 2022, we had £200 million of outstanding loans under our revolving facilities and access to undrawn revolving facilities of £100 million.
We also maintain a mixture of long-term debt and capacity under our revolving facilities in order to ensure that we have sufficient funds available for short-term working capital requirements and for investment in the playing squad and other capital projects.
Our cost base is more evenly spread throughout the fiscal year than our cash inflows. Employee benefit expenses and fixed costs constitute the majority of our cash outflows and are generally paid throughout the 12 months of the fiscal year.
In addition, transfer windows for acquiring and disposing of registrations occur in January and the summer. During these periods, we may require additional cash to meet our acquisition needs for new players and we may generate additional cash through the sale of existing registrations. Depending on the terms of the agreement, transfer fees may be paid or received by us in multiple installments, resulting in deferred cash paid or received. Although we have not historically drawn on our revolving facilities during the summer transfer window, if we seek to acquire players with values substantially in excess of the values of players we seek to sell, we may be required to utilize cash available from our revolving facilities to meet our cash needs.
7

Acquisition and disposal of registrations also affects our trade receivables and payables, which affects our overall working capital. Our trade receivables include transfer fees receivable from other football clubs, whereas our trade payables include transfer fees and other associated costs payable to other football clubs in relation to the acquisition of registrations.

Net cash (outflow)/inflow from operating activities Cash generated from operations represents our operating results and net movements in our working capital. Our working capital is generally impacted by the timing of cash received from the sale of tickets and hospitality and other Matchday revenues, broadcasting revenues from the Premier League and UEFA and sponsorship and other commercial revenues. Our working capital is also impacted by the timing of receipts and payments with respect to disposals and acquisitions of player registrations. Cash used in operations for the six months ended 31 December 2022 was £53.0 million compared to cash generated from operations of £46.1 million for the six months ended 31 December 2021.
Additional changes in net cash inflow from operating activities generally reflect our finance costs. We currently pay fixed rates of interest on our senior secured notes and variable rates of interest on our secured term loan facility. We use interest rate swaps to manage the cash flow interest rate risk. Such swaps have the economic effect of converting a portion of interest from variable rates to a fixed rate. Drawdowns from our revolving facilities are also subject to variable rates of interest. Net cash (outflow)/inflow from operating activities for the six months ended 31 December 2022 was £67.5 million compared to net cash inflow of £32.1 million for the six months ended 31 December 2021.
Net cash outflow from investing activities Capital expenditure for the acquisition of intangible assets as well as for improvements to property, principally at Old Trafford and Carrington, are funded through cash flow generated from operations, proceeds from the sale of intangible assets and, if necessary, from our revolving facilities. Capital expenditure on the acquisition, disposal and trading of intangible assets tends to vary significantly from year to year depending on the requirements of our men’s first team, overall availability of players, our assessment of their relative value and competitive demand for players from other clubs. By contrast, capital expenditure on the purchase of property, plant and equipment tends to remain relatively stable as we continue to make improvements at Old Trafford and Carrington.
Net cash outflow from investing activities for the six months ended 31 December 2022 was £123.2 million, an increase of £39.8 million from £83.4 million for the six months ended 31 December 2021.
For the six months ended 31 December 2022, net capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment was £7.1 million, an increase of £1.6 million from £5.5 million for the six months ended 31 December 2021.
For the six months ended 31 December 2022, net capital expenditure on intangible assets was £116.1 million, an increase of £38.2 million from £77.9 million for the six months ended 31 December 2021.
Net cash inflow from financing activities Net cash inflow from financing activities for the six months ended 31 December 2022 was £98.5 million, compared to net cash inflow of £28.4 million for the six months ended 31 December 2021. This is due to a £100.0 million drawdown on the revolving facilities in the current year compared to a £40.0 million drawdown on the revolving facilities in the prior year, combined with a dividend of $0.09 per share being paid in the prior year compared to no payment in the current year.
Indebtedness Our primary sources of indebtedness consist of our senior secured notes, our secured term loan facility and our revolving facilities. As part of the security for our senior secured notes, our secured term loan facility and our revolving facilities, substantially all of our assets are subject to liens and mortgages.
Description of principal indebtedness
Senior secured notes Our wholly owned subsidiary, Manchester United Football Club Limited, issued $425 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.79% senior secured notes. As of 31 December 2022 the sterling equivalent of £350.6 million (net of unamortized issue costs of £2.4 million) was outstanding. The outstanding principal amount was $425.0 million. The senior secured notes mature on 25 June 2027.
9

The senior secured notes are guaranteed by Red Football Limited, Red Football Junior Limited, Manchester United Limited and MU Finance Limited and secured against substantially all of the assets of those entities and Manchester United Football Club Limited. These entities are wholly owned subsidiaries of Manchester United plc.
The note purchase agreement governing the senior secured notes contains a financial maintenance covenant requiring us to maintain consolidated profit for the period before depreciation, amortization of, and profit/(loss) on disposal of, intangible assets, exceptional items, net finance costs, and tax (“EBITDA”) of not less than £65 million for each 12 month testing period (reduced to £25 million during the period 31 March 2021 to 31 March 2023 inclusive). We are able to claim certain dispensations from complying with the consolidated EBITDA floor up to twice (in non-consecutive financial years) during the life of the senior secured notes if we fail to qualify for the first round group stages (or its equivalent from time to time) of the UEFA Champions League. The impact of IFRS 16 is excluded for the purpose of covenant compliance testing. The covenant is tested on a quarterly basis and we were in compliance as of 31 December 2022.
The note purchase agreement governing the senior secured notes contains events of default typical for securities of this type, as well as customary covenants and restrictions on the activities of Red Football Limited and each of Red Football Limited’s subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, the incurrence of additional indebtedness; dividends or distributions in respect of capital stock or certain other restricted payments or investments; entering into agreements that restrict distributions from restricted subsidiaries; the sale or disposal of assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries; transactions with affiliates; the incurrence of liens; and mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of Red Football Limited’s assets. The covenants in the note purchase agreement governing the senior secured notes are subject to certain thresholds and exceptions described in the note purchase agreement governing the senior secured notes.
The senior secured notes may be redeemed in part, in an amount not less than 5% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior secured notes then outstanding, or in full, at any time at 100% of the principal amount plus a “makewhole” premium of an amount equal to the discounted value (based on the US Treasury rate) of the remaining interest payments due on the senior secured notes up to 25 June 2027.
Secured term loan facility Our wholly owned subsidiary, Manchester United Football Club Limited, has a secured term loan facility with Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Designated Activity Company as lender. As of 31 December 2022, the sterling equivalent of £185.0 million (net of unamortized issue costs of £1.9 million) was outstanding. The outstanding principal amount was $225.0 million. The remaining balance of the secured term loan facility is repayable on 6 August 2029, although the Group has the option to repay the secured term loan facility at any time before then.

Loans under the secured term loan facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to US dollar LIBOR (provided that if the rate is less than zero, LIBOR shall be deemed to be zero) plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin, if no event of default has occurred and is continuing, means the following:

Margin %

Total net leverage ratio (as defined in the secured term loan facility agreement)

(per annum)

Greater than 3.5 ............................................................................................................................... 1.75

Greater than 2.0 but less than or equal to 3.5................................................................................... 1.50

Less than or equal to 2.0 .................................................................................................................. 1.25

While any event of default is continuing, the applicable margin shall be the highest level set forth above.
Our secured term loan facility is guaranteed by Red Football Limited, Red Football Junior Limited, Manchester United Limited, MU Finance Limited and Manchester United Football Club Limited and secured against substantially all of the assets of those entities. These entities are wholly owned subsidiaries of Manchester United plc.

The secured term loan facility contains a financial maintenance covenant requiring us to maintain consolidated profit for the period before depreciation, amortization of, and profit/(loss) on disposal of, intangible assets, exceptional items, net finance costs, and tax (“EBITDA”) of not less than £65 million for each 12 month testing period (reduced to £25 million during the period 31 March 2021 to 31 March 2023 inclusive). We are able to claim certain dispensations from complying with the consolidated EBITDA floor up to twice (in non-consecutive financial years) during the life of the secured term loan facility if we fail to qualify for the first round group stages (or its equivalent from time to time) of the UEFA Champions League. The impact of IFRS 16 is excluded for the purpose of covenant compliance testing. The covenant is tested on a quarterly basis and we were in compliance as of 31 December 2022.
The secured term loan facility contains events of default typical in facilities of this type, as well as typical covenants including restrictions on incurring additional indebtedness, paying dividends or making other distributions or repurchasing or redeeming our stock, selling assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries, entering into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, consolidating, merging, selling or otherwise disposing of all or substantially all of our assets, entering into sale and leaseback transactions, entering into transactions with our affiliates and incurring liens. Certain events of default and covenants in the secured term loan facility are subject to certain thresholds and exceptions described in the agreement governing the secured term loan facility.

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Transfer fees payable Under the terms of certain contracts with other football clubs in respect of player transfers, additional amounts would be payable by us if certain specific performance conditions are met. We estimate the fair value of any contingent consideration at the date of acquisition based on the probability of conditions being met and monitor this on an ongoing basis. The maximum additional amount that could be payable as of 31 December 2022 is £141.1 million (30 June 2022: £112.4 million; 31 December 2021: £122.4 million). As of 31 December 2022, £5.8 million of these contingent fees are capitalized (30 June 2022: £6.2 million; 31 December 2021: £8.0 million). Transfer fees receivable Similarly, under the terms of contracts with other football clubs for player transfers, additional amounts would be payable to us if certain specific performance conditions are met. In accordance with the recognition criteria for contingent assets, such amounts are only disclosed by the Company when probable and recognized when virtually certain. As of 31 December 2022, we believe receipt of £nil to be probable (30 June 2022: £nil; 30 December 2021: £nil). Other commitments In the ordinary course of business, we enter into capital commitments. These transactions are recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), and are more fully disclosed therein. As of 31 December 2022, we had not entered into any other off-balance sheet transactions.

(1) Each element of finance costs and finance income is split based on its position in both the 3 months ended 31 December 2022 and the 6 months ended 31 December 2022. In the current year, exchange rate fluctuations have resulted in costs and income for the 3 months ended 31 December 2022 that are greater than the total net position across the 6 months ended 31 December 2022.

(2) For the six months ended 31 December 2022 and the three and six months ended 31 December 2021, potential ordinary shares are anti-dilutive, as their inclusion in the diluted loss per share calculation would reduce the loss per share, and hence have been excluded.

(1) Payments and proceeds for intangible assets primarily relate to player and key football management staff registrations. When acquiring or selling players’ and key football management staff registrations it is normal industry practice for payment terms to spread over more than one year and consideration may also include non-cash items. Details of registrations additions and disposals are provided in Note 17. Trade payables in relation to the acquisition of registrations at the reporting date are provided in Note 25. Trade receivables in relation to the disposal of registrations at the reporting date are provided in Note 20.

Manchester United plc Interim consolidated statement of cash flows - unaudited
1 General information Manchester United plc (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together the “Group”) is a men’s and women’s professional football club together with related and ancillary activities. The Company incorporated under the Companies Law (as amended) of the Cayman Islands. The Company’s shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “MANU”.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) except when otherwise indicated.
These interim consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Audit Committee on 31 March 2023.
2 Basis of preparation The interim consolidated financial statements of Manchester United plc have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting”. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended 30 June 2022, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on 23 September 2022, contained within the Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F, which were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). The report of the auditors on those financial statements was unqualified and did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph. The results of operations for the interim periods should not be considered indicative of results to be expected for the full fiscal year.
Going concern The Group has cash resources as of 31 December 2022 of £31.0 million, with all funds held as cash and cash equivalents and therefore available on demand. As of 31 December 2022, the Group also has access to undrawn revolving facilities of £100 million.
The Group’s debt facilities include the $425 million senior secured notes and the $225 million secured term loan facility, the majority of which attract fixed interest rates. As of 31 December 2022, the Group also has £200 million of outstanding loans under our revolving facilities. The Group’s secured notes and term loan mature in 2027 and 2029 respectively. Of the Group’s total available revolving facilities of £300 million, £150 million expires in 2025 and £150m expires in 2027. As of 31 December 2022, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.
As a result of a detailed assessment, including prudent assumptions around the men’s first team’s performance, and with reference to the Group’s balance sheet, existing committed facilities, but also acknowledging the inherent uncertainty of the current economic outlook, Management has concluded that the Group is able to meet its obligations when they fall due for a period of at least 12 months after the date of this report. For this reason, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis for preparing the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements.

Manchester United plc Notes to the interim consolidated financial statements – unaudited (continued)

3 Accounting policies The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2022, except as described below.

Taxes on income in the interim periods are accrued using the tax rate that would be applicable to expected total annual earnings.

New and amended standards and interpretations adopted by the Group No new or amended IFRS standards or interpretations, effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 July 2022, have had a material impact on the interim consolidated financial statements of the Group.

New and amended standards and interpretations issued but not yet adopted There are no IFRS or IFRS IC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group in the future reporting periods or on foreseeable future transactions.

Effect of IBOR reform For the year ended 30 June 2021, we adopted the Phase 2 amendments to IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments” for the first time.

On 10 December 2021 and 13 December 2021, the Group amended and restated its revolving facility agreements with Bank of America and Santander plc respectively, to provide for an alternate method of calculating our interest rates following the cessation of GBP LIBOR and the 1-week and 2-month USD LIBOR rates. Interest is now calculated based on the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) plus a credit adjustment spread.

Our secured term loan facility of $225.0 million remains subject to USD LIBOR which is expected to be phased out completely by 30 June 2023. Therefore, in due course, the Group will need to re-negotiate terms with its lender and amend the terms of the related interest swap. Such amendments are expected to be achieved without material financial impact to the Group.

The following table contains details of all financial instruments held at 31 December 2022 which reference USD LIBOR and have not yet transitioned to an alternative interest rate benchmark, such that phase 1 reliefs continue to be applied to the hedge relationship as there remains uncertainty arising from IBOR reform:

Manchester United plc Notes to the interim consolidated financial statements – unaudited (continued)
3 Accounting policies (continued)
Effect of IBOR reform (continued) The Group has adopted the following hedge accounting reliefs provided by Phase 2 of the amendments:
(i) Hedge designation – When the Phase 1 amendments cease to apply, the group will amend its cash flow hedge designation to reflect changes which are required by IBOR reform, but only to make one or more of these changes: • Designating an alternative benchmark rate (contractually or non-contractually specified) as a hedged risk; • Amending the description of the hedged item, including the designated portion of the cash flows being hedged; or • Amending the description of the hedging instrument.
The Group will update its hedge documentation to reflect these changes at the end of the reporting period in which the changes are made. The amendments to hedge documentation do not require the Group to discontinue the cash flow hedge relationship.
(ii) Risk components – The Group is permitted to designate an alternative benchmark rate as a noncontractually specified risk component, even if it is not separately identifiable at the date when it is designated, provided that the Group reasonably expects that it will meet the requirements within 24 months of the first designation and the risk component is reliably measurable. The Group has not designated any alternative benchmark rates as risk components in any hedge relationships during the period.
4 Critical estimates and judgments The preparation of interim financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the interim consolidated financial statements are considered to be: • Estimate of minimum guarantee revenue recognition – see Note 5 • Estimate of fair value of registrations – see Note 17 • Recognition of deferred tax assets – see Note 18 • Recognition of tax related provisions – see Note 27
Management does not consider there to be any significant judgements in the preparation of the financial statements.
In preparing these interim consolidated financial statements, the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2022.
21

Manchester United plc Notes to the interim consolidated financial statements – unaudited (continued)
5 Seasonality of revenue We experience seasonality in our revenue and cash flow, limiting the overall comparability of interim financial periods. In any given interim period, our total revenue can vary based on the number of games played in that period, which affects the amount of Matchday and Broadcasting revenue recognized. This is particularly evident in the 2022/23 season, in which the Premier League Season paused for six weeks in November 2022 for the FIFA World Cup to take place. Similarly, certain of our costs are derived from hosting games at Old Trafford, and these costs will also vary based on the number of games played in the period. We historically recognize the most revenue in our second and third fiscal quarters due to the scheduling of matches. However, a strong performance by our first team in European competitions and domestic cups could result in significant additional Matchday and Broadcasting revenue, and consequently we may also recognize the most revenue in our fourth fiscal quarter in those years.
i) Commercial Commercial revenue (whether settled in cash or value in kind) comprises revenue receivable from the exploitation of the Manchester United brand through sponsorship and other commercial agreements, including minimum guaranteed revenue, revenue receivable from retailing Manchester United branded merchandise in the UK and licensing the manufacture, distribution and sale of such goods globally, and fees for the Manchester United men’s first team undertaking tours. Revenue is recognized over the term of the sponsorship agreement in line with the performance obligations included within the contract and based on the sponsorship rights enjoyed by the individual sponsor. In instances where the sponsorship rights remain the same over the duration of the contract, revenue is recognized as performance obligations are satisfied evenly over time (i.e. on a straight-line basis). Retail revenue is recognized when control of the products has transferred, being at the point of sale to the customer. License revenue in respect of right to access licences is recognized in line with the performance obligations included within the contract, in instances where these remain the same over the duration of the contract, revenue is recognized evenly on a time elapsed (i.e. straight-line) basis. Sales-based royalty revenue is recognized only when the subsequent sale is made.
Significant estimates A number of sponsorship contracts contain significant estimates in relation to the allocation and recognition of revenue in line with performance obligations. Minimum guaranteed revenue is recognized over the term of the sponsorship agreement in line with the performance obligations included within the contract and based on the sponsorship benefits enjoyed by the individual sponsor. In instances where the sponsorship rights remain the same over the duration of the contract, revenue is recognized as performance obligations are satisfied evenly over time (i.e. on a straight-line basis).
The Group has a 10-year agreement with adidas which began on 1 August 2015. The minimum guarantee payable by adidas over the term of the agreement is £750 million, subject to certain adjustments. Payments due in a particular year may increase if the club’s men’s first team wins the Premier League, FA Cup or Champions League, or decrease if the club’s men’s first team fails to participate in the Champions League for two or more consecutive seasons with the maximum possible increase being £4 million per year and the maximum possible reduction being 30% of the applicable payment for the year in which the second or other consecutive season of non-participation falls. Participation in the UEFA Champions League is typically secured via a top 4 finish in the Premier League or winning the UEFA Europa League. Revenue is currently being recognized based on management’s estimate as at 31 December 2022 that the full minimum guarantee amount is the most likely amount that will be received, as management does not expect two consecutive seasons of non-participation in the Champions League.
22

Manchester United plc Notes to the interim consolidated financial statements – unaudited (continued)
5 Seasonality of revenue (continued) ii) Broadcasting Broadcasting revenue represents revenue receivable from all UK and overseas broadcasting contracts, including contracts negotiated centrally by the Premier League and UEFA. Distributions from the Premier League comprise a fixed element (which is recognized evenly as each performance obligation is satisfied i.e. as each Premier League match is played), facility fees for live coverage and highlights of domestic home and away matches (which are recognized when the respective performance obligation is satisfied i.e. the respective match is played), and merit awards (which, being variable consideration, are recognized when each performance obligation is satisfied i.e. as each Premier League match is played, based on management’s estimate of where the men’s first team will finish at the end of the football season i.e. the most likely outcome and to the extent that it is deemed highly probably that no revenue recognized will be reversed). Distributions from UEFA relating to participation in European competitions comprise market pool payments (which are recognized over the matches played in the competition, a portion of which reflects Manchester United’s performance relative to the other Premier League clubs in the competition), fixed amounts for participation in individual matches (which are recognized when the matches are played) and an individual club coefficient share (which is recognized over the group stage matches). iii) Matchday Matchday revenue is recognized based on matches played throughout the year with revenue from each match (including season ticket allocated amounts) only being recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied i.e. the match has been played. Revenue from related activities such as Conference and Events or the Museum is recognized as the event or service is provided or the facility is used. Matchday revenue includes revenue receivable from all domestic and European match day activities from Manchester United games at Old Trafford, together with the Group’s share of gate receipts from domestic cup matches not played at Old Trafford, and fees for arranging other events at the Old Trafford stadium. As the Group acts as the principal in the sale of match tickets, the share of gate receipts payable to the other participating club and competition organizer for domestic cup matches played at Old Trafford is treated as an operating expense.

6 Revenue from contracts with customers

6.1 Disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers
The principal activity of the Group is the operation of men’s and women’s professional football clubs. All of the activities of the Group support the operation of the football clubs and the success of the men’s first team in particular is critical to the on-going development of the Group. Consequently the chief operating decision maker (being the Board and executive officers of Manchester United plc) regards the Group as operating in one material segment, being the operation of professional football clubs.

All revenue derives from the Group’s principal activity in the United Kingdom. Revenue can be analysed into its three main components as follows:

Commercial, broadcasting and Matchday consideration which is received in advance of the performance obligation being satisfied is treated as a contract liability (deferred revenue). The deferred revenue is then recognized as revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. The Group receives substantial amounts of deferred revenue prior to the previous financial year end which is then recognized as revenue throughout the current year and, where applicable, future financial years.

Tax is recognized based on management’s estimate of the weighted average annual tax rate expected for the full financial year. Based on current forecasts, the estimated weighted average annual tax rate used for the year to 30 June 2023 is 20.99% (30 June 2022: 23.43%).

The current year estimated weighted average annual tax rate of 20.99% is driven by UK deferred tax movements, recognized at the substantively enacted increase in UK Corporation tax rate of 25%, effective April 2023.

The prior year estimated weighted average annual tax rate of 23.43% was also largely driven by the UK deferred tax movements.

In addition to the amounts recognized in the statement of profit or loss, the following amounts relating to tax have

(i) Basic earnings/(loss) per share Basic earnings/(loss) per share is calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) for the period by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.

(ii) Diluted earnings/(loss) per share Diluted earnings/(loss) per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Company has one category of dilutive potential ordinary shares: share awards pursuant to the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Equity Plan”). Share awards pursuant to the Equity Plan are assumed to have been converted into ordinary shares at the beginning of the financial year, or, if later, the date of issue of the potential ordinary shares.

(1) For the six months ended 31 December 2022 and the three and six months ended 31 December 2021, potential ordinary shares are anti-dilutive, as their inclusion in the diluted loss per share calculation would reduce the loss per share, and hence have been excluded.

13 Dividends Dividends paid in the six months ended 31 December 2022 amounted to £nil. Dividends paid in the six months ended 31 December 2021 amounted to $14,669,000 ($0.09 per share), the pounds sterling equivalent of which was £10,669,000.

(iii) The group’s leasing activities and how these are accounted for The Group leases various offices and equipment. All leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value, are recognized as a right-of-use asset, with a corresponding lease liability, at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group.

The lease agreements do not impose any covenants other than the security interests in the right-of-use assets that are held by the lessor. Right-of-use assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.

Lease liabilities are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of lease payments, less any lease incentives receivable. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be determined, which is generally the case for leases of the Group, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the Group would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.

Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

Right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost comprising the following: • the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability; • any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received; • any initial direct costs; and • restoration costs.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. Payments associated with short-term leases of property, plant and equipment and all leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less.

Investment properties were externally valued as of 30 June 2022 in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (“RICS”) Valuation - Global Standards 2017 on the basis of Fair Value (as defined in the Standards). The fair value of investment properties as of 30 June 2022 was £38,250,000. Management has considered the carrying amount of investment property as of 31 December 2022 and concluded that, as there are no indicators of impairment, an impairment test is not required.

Fair value of investment properties is determined using inputs that are not based on observable market data, consequently the asset is categorized as Level 3.

17 Intangible assets (continued) Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested annually for impairment (normally at the end of the third fiscal quarter) or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Management has considered the carrying amount of goodwill as of 31 December 2022 and concluded that, as there are no indicators of impairment, a detailed impairment test is not required. Having assessed the future anticipated cash flows, management believes that any reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would not result in an impairment of goodwill. Significant estimates – fair value of registrations The costs associated with the acquisition of players’ and key football management staff registrations include an estimate of the fair value of any contingent consideration. The estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration payable requires management to assess the likelihood of specific performance conditions being met which would trigger the payment of the contingent consideration. This assessment is carried out on an individual basis. The maximum additional amount that could be payable as of 31 December 2022 is disclosed in Note 31.1. The estimate over the probability of contingent consideration payable could impact the net book value of registrations and amortization recognized in the statement of profit or loss. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets include internally generated assets whose cost and accumulated amortization as of 31 December 2022 was £2,103,000 and £2,101,000 respectively (31 December 2021: £2,103,000 and £2,067,000 respectively).

Group profits are subject to both UK and US corporate tax. The current US federal corporate income tax rate is 21% compared to the substantively enacted UK corporation tax rate of 25%. As the UK corporation tax rate is higher than the US federal corporate income tax rate, it is forecast that all future US cash tax will be sheltered by foreign tax credits derived from UK tax paid. A potential US deferred tax asset at the period end has therefore not been recognised as it is not forecast to give rise to a future economic benefit. Future increases in the US federal corporate income tax rate could result in the recognition of the US deferred tax asset.

Significant estimates – recognition of deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the associated deductions will be available for use against future profits and that there will be sufficient future taxable profit available against which the temporary differences can be utilized, provided the asset can be reliably quantified. In estimating future taxable profit, management use “base case” approved forecasts which incorporate a number of assumptions, including a prudent level of future uncontracted revenue in the forecast period. In arriving at a judgment in relation to the recognition of deferred tax assets, management considers the regulations applicable to tax, advice on their interpretation and potential future business planning. Future taxable income may be higher or lower than estimates made when determining whether it is appropriate to record a tax asset and the amount to be recorded. Furthermore, changes in the legislative framework or applicable tax case law may result in management reassessing the recognition of deferred tax assets in future periods.

Fair value hierarchy Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value. The different levels used in measuring fair value have been defined in accounting standards as follows: • Level 1 – the fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the
end of the reporting period. • Level 2 - the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using
valuation techniques which maximize the use of observable market data and as little as possible on entityspecific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. • Level 3 – if one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.
All of the financial instruments detailed above are included in Level 2.

The Company has two classes of ordinary shares outstanding: Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares, each with a par value of $0.0005 per share. The rights of the holders of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion. Each Class A ordinary share is entitled to one vote per share and is not convertible into any other shares. Each Class B ordinary share is entitled to 10 votes per share and is convertible into one Class A ordinary share at any time. In addition, Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares upon certain transfers and other events, including upon the date when holders of all Class B ordinary shares cease to hold Class B ordinary shares representing, in the aggregate, at least 10% of the total number of Class A and Class B ordinary shares outstanding. For special resolutions (which are required for certain important matters including mergers and changes to the Company’s governing documents), which require the vote of two-thirds of the votes cast, at any time that Class B ordinary shares remain outstanding, the voting power permitted to be exercised by the holders of the Class B ordinary shares will be weighted such that the Class B ordinary shares shall represent, in the aggregate, 67% of the voting power of all shareholders.

As of 31 December 2022, the Company’s issued share capital comprised 54,537,360 Class A ordinary shares and 110,207,613 Class B ordinary shares.

1,682,896 Class A ordinary shares are currently held in treasury. Distributable reserves have been reduced by £21,305,000, being the consideration paid for these shares. See Note 24.

29 Pension arrangements The Group participates in the Football League Pension and Life Assurance Scheme (‘the Scheme’). The Scheme is a funded multi-employer defined benefit scheme where members may have periods of service attributable to several participating employers. The Group is unable to identify its share of the assets and liabilities of the Scheme and therefore accounts for its contributions as if they were paid to a defined contribution scheme. The Group has received confirmation that the assets and liabilities of the Scheme cannot be split between the participating employers. The Group is advised only of the additional contributions it is required to pay to make good the deficit. These contributions could increase in the future if one or more of the participating employers exits the Scheme. The last triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out at 31 August 2020 where the total deficit on the ongoing valuation basis was £27.5 million. The accrual of benefits ceased within the Scheme on 31 August 1999, therefore there are no contributions relating to current accrual. The Group pays monthly contributions based on a notional split of the total expenses and deficit contributions of the Scheme. The Group currently pays total contributions of £555,000 per annum and this amount will increase by 5% per annum from September 2023. Based on the existing actuarial valuation assumptions, this will be sufficient to pay off the deficit by 30 April 2025. As of 31 December 2022, the present value of the Group’s outstanding contributions (i.e. its future liability) is £1,332,000. This amounts to £555,000 (30 June 2022: £556,000; 31 December 2021: £533,000) due within one year and £777,000 (30 June 2022: £1,046,000; 31 December 2021: £1,332,000) due after more than one year and is included within other payables. Contributions are also made to defined contribution pension arrangements and are charged to the statement of profit or loss in the period in which they become payable.

30 Financial risk management

30.1 Financial risk factors The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, and cash flow and fair value interest rate risk), credit risk, and liquidity risk.

The interim consolidated financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements, they should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended 30 June 2022, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on 23 September 2022, contained within the Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F.

There have been no changes in risk management since the previous financial year end or in any risk management policies.

30.2 Hedging activities The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain exposures and has designated certain derivatives as hedges of cash flows (cash flow hedge).

The Group hedges the foreign exchange risk on contracted future US dollar revenues whenever possible using the Group’s US dollar net borrowings as the hedging instrument. The foreign exchange gains or losses arising on re-translation of the Group’s US dollar net borrowings used in the hedge are initially recognized in other comprehensive income, rather than being recognized in the statement of profit or loss immediately. Amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve are subsequently reclassified into the statement of profit or loss in the same accounting period, and within the same statement of profit or loss line (i.e. commercial revenue), as the underlying future US dollar revenues, which given the varying lengths of the commercial revenue contracts will be between January 2023 to May 2027. The foreign exchange gains or losses arising on re-translation of the Group’s unhedged US dollar borrowings are recognized in the statement of profit or loss immediately (within net finance costs). The table below details the net borrowings being hedged at the balance sheet date:

30 Financial risk management (continued)

30.2 Hedging activities (continued) The Group hedges its cash flow interest rate risk where considered appropriate using interest rate swaps. Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting a portion of variable rate borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap is initially recognized in other comprehensive income, rather than being recognized in the statement of profit or loss immediately. Amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve are subsequently reclassified into the statement of profit or loss in the same accounting period, and within the same statement of profit or loss line (i.e. net finance costs), as the underlying interest payments, which given the term of the swap will be between January 2023 to June 2024. The following table details the interest rate swaps at the reporting date that are used to hedge borrowings:

As of 31 December 2022, the fair value of the above interest rate swap was an asset of £4,901,000 (30 June 2022: asset of £2,458,000; 31 December 2021: liability of £3,045,000).

The Group also seeks to hedge the majority of the foreign exchange risk on revenue arising as a result of participation in UEFA club competitions, either by using contracted future foreign exchange expenses (including player transfer fee commitments) or by placing forward foreign exchange contracts, at the point at which it becomes reasonably certain that it will receive the revenue. The Group also seeks to hedge the foreign exchange risk on other contracted future foreign exchange expenses using available foreign exchange cash balances and forward foreign exchange contracts.

amounts, in excess of the amounts included in the cost of registrations, would be payable by the Group if certain

substantive performance conditions are met. These excess amounts are only recognized within the cost of

registrations when the Group considers that it is probable that the condition related to the payment will be achieved.

The maximum additional amounts that could be payable is £141,097,000 (30 June 2022: £112,372,000; 31

December 2021: £122,604,000). No material adjustment was required to the amounts included in the cost of

registrations during the period (2021: no material adjustments) and consequently there was no material impact on

the amortization of registration charges in the statement of profit or loss (2021: no material impact). As of 31

December 2022, the potential amount payable by type of condition and category of player was:

(ii) Tax matters We are currently in active discussions with UK tax authorities over a number of tax areas in relation to arrangements with players and players' representatives. It is possible that in the future, as a result of discussions between the Group and UK tax authorities, as well as discussions UK tax authorities are holding with other stakeholders within the football industry, interpretations of applicable rules will be challenged, which could result in liabilities in relation to these matters. The information usually required by IAS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’, is not disclosed on the grounds that it is not practicable to be disclosed.

31.2 Contingent assets

(i) Transfer fees Under the terms of certain contracts with other football clubs in respect of player transfers, additional amounts would be payable to the Group if certain specific performance conditions are met. In accordance with the recognition criteria for contingent assets, such amounts are only disclosed by the Group when probable and recognized when virtually certain. As of 31 December 2022, the amount of such receipt considered to be probable was £nil (30 June 2022: £nil; 31 December 2021: £nil).
