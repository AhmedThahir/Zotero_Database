The Fastest Typing Speed

The highest typing speed ever recorded was 216 words per minute (wpm), set by Stella Pajunas in 1946, using an IBM electric typewriter. Currently, the fastest English language typist is Barbara Blackburn, who reached a peak typing speed of 212 wpm during a test in 2005, using a Dvorak simplified keyboard.

The average wpm speed is only 41.4 words in one minute. This is far below the speeds of the record holders, or even the speeds that are needed to be successful in the working world. However, it is considered a good typing speed.
Who Types Faster?

The average typing speed for boys is 44 words per minute. This is slightly faster than for girls, who clock in at 37 wpm, a full 7 word per minute slower. This seems a little odd, because statistics show that girls actually enjoy practicing their typing skills more than boys do.

You can take a typing test online at any time to test your skills and find out if you are faster than the average typist.
Any Typos?

The average accuracy for a typist is around 92%, meaning they make 8 mistakes for every 100 words typed. The desired accuracy for professional typing positions is around 97% or higher.
Above the Average

Practice is the key factor in becoming a professional typist, or a typist of any appreciable skill. Let's repeat that, just to make sure it sinks in. Practice, practice, practice. Activity analysis has shown that people who type faster than average tend to practice 3 times longer than those who have average or below average wpm speeds.
When to Start Learning

Developed typing skills can help young people get better study results in school or college, and get better job offers once they have finished school. 65% of people who learn how to touch type faster are under the age of 24. The main goal of learning to touch type or improving touch typing skills, after age 25 is to become more successful in current job.
Motivation

Improving touch typing skills is a must for every person under 18, but everyone can benefit from some time spent practicing. Average typing speed is one of the key skills listed on your resume. Spend some more time practicing and get better results with Ratatype.
