1. Overview
The forecasts for the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) are provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The quarterly survey, formerly conducted by the American Statistical Association (ASA) and the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), began in 1968:Q4 and was taken over by the Philadelphia Fed in 1990:Q2.
The data set contains all variables currently included in the survey. Some variables have been in the survey since 1968:Q4; others were added in the survey of 1981:Q3. In recent years, we added the following variables:
• Long-Term Projections. Beginning with the survey of 1992:Q1, we added long-term forecasts for 10-year annual-average real GDP growth and productivity growth (RGDP10 and PROD10). We also added 10-year annual-average forecasts for returns on S&P 500 stocks, three-month Treasury bills, and 10-year Treasury bonds (STOCK10, BILL10, and BOND10). These long-term forecasts appear in firstquarter surveys only.
• Natural Rate of Unemployment. In the survey of 1996:Q3, we added forecasts for the natural rate of unemployment (UBAR). This variable appears in third-quarter surveys only.
• Nonfarm Payroll Employment. In the survey of 2003:Q4, we added forecasts for nonfarm payroll employment (EMP).
• Long-Term CPI Inflation. In the survey of 2005:Q3, we added forecasts for the five-year annual-average rate of headline CPI inflation (CPI5YR). We also extended the forecast horizon one year for fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter headline CPI inflation.
• Short-Term CPI and PCE Inflation. In the survey of 2007:Q1, we added forecasts for core CPI inflation (CORECPI), headline PCE inflation (PCE), and core PCE inflation (COREPCE).
• Core CPI and Core PCE Probabilities. In the survey 2007:Q1, we added density projections for core CPI inflation (PRCCPI) and core PCE inflation (PRCPCE).
• Unemployment and Real GDP Probabilities. In the survey of 2009:Q2, we added density projections for the civilian unemployment rate (PRUNEMP). We also extended the annual forecast horizon two years for density projections for real GDP growth (PRGDP).
• Baa Interest Rate. In the survey of 2010:Q1, we added projections for the rate on Moody’s Baa corporate bond yields (BAABOND).

3
In the surveys conducted since the Philadelphia Fed took over, the forecasters provide quarterly projections for five quarters and annual projections for the current year and the following year. Except as noted in the pages below, the format of the survey is the same as it was when we took it over. However, in recent years, we made the following changes to the forecast horizons:
• Annual Horizons for Unemployment and Real GDP. Beginning with the 2009:Q2 survey, we asked the forecasters to provide two more years of annual projections for the annual-average civilian unemployment rate (UNEMP) and annual-average real GDP (RGDP).
• Annual Horizons for Interest Rates. Beginning with the 2009:Q3 survey, we asked the forecasters to provide two more years of annual projections for the annual-average rates on three-month Treasury bills (TBILL) rate and 10-year Treasury bonds (TBOND).
This documentation provides information on the variables forecast and the format of the files. We begin with a listing and description of the files and the survey’s timing. We then discuss the following topics:
• Section 2 discusses the organization of the files for median and mean forecasts for the levels of variables. We also document the names of the variables. Importantly, this section describes any caveats on particular survey variables.
• Section 3 discusses forecasts for growth rates. For most survey variables, we construct growth rates as the rate of growth in the mean or median forecast for the level. The exceptions are the headline and core CPI and PCE inflation rates, which enter the survey in growth-rate form.
• Section 4 discusses the files for individual forecasts. The organization of the files is similar to that for the mean and median forecasts. Important caveats exist in using the individual responses.
• Section 5 discusses a special file that we have constructed for one-year-ahead and 10year-ahead forecasts for CPI inflation.
• Section 6 discusses the survey’s density projections.
• Section 7 discusses an alternative way of presenting the data by the variable forecast.
• Section 8 discusses the files containing the projections for the natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU). This variable enters the survey only in the third quarter.
• Section 9 discusses the data files and our computations for cross-sectional forecast dispersion.

4
• Section 10 discusses implied forecasts for 21 variables that do not directly enter the survey. This includes projections for interest-rate term spreads, real interest rates, and forward inflation rates.
• Section 11 lists the changes made to this document.

Overview: Timing of the Survey. The Philadelphia Fed’s first survey was the one for 1990:Q2. However, this survey was not conducted in real time because we had not yet taken over full responsibility from the ASA/NBER. For this survey, the forecasters were asked to provide dated forecasts from May 1990.
The first survey we conducted in real time was the one for 1990:Q3. With a few minor exceptions noted below, we have maintained a consistent timing in conducting the surveys since the 1990:Q3 survey. We now discuss several topics related to the survey’s timing. The topics are:
• Information sets and deadlines; • Survey release dates; and • Timing of surveys prior to the 1990:Q2 survey.
Information Sets and Deadlines. The survey’s timing is geared to the release of the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s (BEA) advance report of the national income and product accounts (NIPA). This report is released at the end of the first month of each quarter. It contains the first estimate of GDP (and components) for the previous quarter. We send our survey questionnaires after this report is released to the public. The survey’s questionnaires report recent historical values of the data from the BEA’s advance report and the most recent reports of other government statistical agencies. Thus, in submitting their projections, our panelists’ information sets include the data reported in the advance report.
For the surveys, we conducted after the 1990:Q2 survey, we have set the deadlines for responses at late in the second to third week of the middle month of each quarter. A complete list of the dates of deadlines for surveys from 1990:Q2 to the present is available on the Philadelphia Fed’s website at https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/surveysand-data/survey-of-professional-forecasters/spf-release-dates.txt.
For some variables, notably those contained in the Bureau of Labor Statistics’s (BLS) monthly Employment Situation Summary, there could be a revision to the data (and an additional monthly observation) compared with the data we reported on the survey questionnaire. This happens when there is a new release of the data after we send the survey questionnaire but before the deadline for returning it. The Employment Situation Summary is a prime example, because the BLS has almost always released this report on the first Friday of each month, after we send the questionnaire and before the deadline. Thus, the information sets of the panelists include the data reported in the Employment Situation Summary that the BLS releases to the public in the middle month of each quarter.
A minor change in the timing of the dates of the deadlines occurred beginning with the survey of 2005:Q1. Beginning with this survey, we tightened our production schedule. The dates of the deadlines for responses were moved up a few days (in most surveys), to the second week of the middle month. (The dates for release to the public were also moved up a few days.)
Survey Release Dates. From 1990:Q3 to 2004:Q4, we released the results of the survey to the public in the fourth week of the middle month of the quarter. Exceptions are noted on the

7 Philadelphia Fed’s website for the survey. Beginning with the survey of 2005:Q1, we advanced the dates of release a few days, to late in the second week of the middle month of the quarter. We always release the results before the BEA’s second report for the national income and product accounts.1 Timing of Surveys Prior to the 1990:Q2 Survey. We do not know with certainty the timing of the surveys conducted by the ASA/NBER. We think that, in broad terms, the timing was similar to that adopted by the Philadelphia Fed. In other words, we think that the questionnaires were sent to panelists after the first (advance) report of the national income and product accounts and that the results were released to the public before the second report. However, because we are uncertain about the ASA/NBER’s timing, our reference dates do not cover surveys prior to that of 1990:Q2.
1 Beginning with the benchmark revision of July 2009, the BEA changed its vintage terminology: Instead of the terminology “Advance,” “Preliminary,” and “Final,” the BEA uses “Advance,” “Second,” and “Third.” The timing of these releases remains the same.

2. Median and Mean Forecasts for Levels
In each survey, the forecasters provide their projections for the next five quarters and for the current and following years.3 The files MedianLevel.xlsx and MeanLevel.xlsx contain the median and mean survey responses. Both files are organized in the same manner. Each is an Excel workbook containing multiple worksheets, with each worksheet containing the forecasts for a particular variable. You move among the worksheets by choosing the appropriate tab at the bottom. These tabs refer to the variable being forecast. We use “#N/A” to denote a missing value. Table 2 defines the variables forecast (worksheet tabs) and provides a brief description of each. In July 2012, we added forecasts for some variables that do not appear directly in the survey. We construct these “implied forecasts” as linear combinations of the forecasts for variables in the survey. Examples are forecasts for real interest rates, the spread between various interest rates, and five-year forward, five-year annual-average inflation rates. Table 2A lists the variables for which we compute “implied forecasts.”
3 See the discussion below for exceptions for the annual forecasts in the surveys of 1985:Q1, 1986:Q1, and 1990:Q1. Beginning with the 2007:Q1 survey, we asked the forecasters to provide the annual forecasts for the current and the next two years for CPI inflation rate, core CPI inflation rate, PCE inflation rate, and core PCE inflation rate. Beginning with the 2010:Q1 survey, we asked the forecasters to provide two more years of annual forecasts for the civilian unemployment rate, three-month Treasury bill rate, 10-year Treasury bond rate, and real GDP.

See the section on “Mean Probability Forecasts” for additional details.

PRUNEMP

First survey to include this variable: 2007:Q1.
Density projections for the annual-average unemployment rate falling into various ranges. Percentage points. The annual-average unemployment rate is the average of the 12 monthly unemployment rates of the year. See the section on “Mean Probability Forecasts” for additional details.

UBAR

First survey to include this variable: 2009:Q2.
Natural rate of unemployment. Percentage points. Third-quarter surveys only. Files for the mean statistics, median statistics, dispersion statistics, and individual responses are for those panelists who provide an estimate and say that they use the natural rate of unemployment in forming their projections.

First survey to include this variable: 1996:Q3.

File Structure: Column Header Nomenclature and Forecast Horizons. We organize the files by the date of the survey. Each row gives the projections from a different survey. The first two columns give the year and quarter in which the survey was conducted. The remaining columns give the forecasts.
As you move across a given row, the columns give the forecast for a different quarterly or annual horizon. We distinguish among the horizons by appending “1” through “6” (quarterly forecasts) or “A” and “B” (annual-average forecasts) to a root name identifying the variable forecast. The number “1” represents the “forecast” for the quarter prior to the quarter in which the survey is conducted. The forecasters know the values of the variables for this quarter at the time they submit their projections. For example, for NIPA variables, these values are the BEA’s advance estimate for the quarter. The forecasters are permitted to forecast a revision to the BEA’s advance estimate but most do not. Thus, the data in this column correspond closely to the BEA’s advance estimate. The number “2” represents the forecast for the current quarter, defined as the quarter in which the survey is conducted. The numbers “3” through “6” represent the forecasts for the four quarters after the current quarter. The letters “A” and “B” represent annual-average forecasts for the current year (the year in which the survey is conducted) and the following year.
Beginning with the 2005:Q3 survey, we extended the annual forecast horizon one year for headline CPI inflation. We use the letters “A,” “B,” and “C” to denote the annual fourthquarter over fourth-quarter inflation forecasts for the year in which we conducted the survey (“A”) and the following two years (“B” and “C”).
Beginning with the 2007:Q1 survey, we added three new inflation variables to the questionnaire: core CPI inflation, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation. Paralleling the aforementioned extension of the headline CPI inflation annual horizon, we also extended the annual horizon for the new variables one year beyond the usual two-year ahead horizon. For these three new inflation variables, the letters “A,” “B,” and “C” represent fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter inflation forecasts for the current year and the next two years. Thus, the meaning of the letters “A,” “B,” and “C” for the new inflation variables is the same as for headline CPI inflation.
Beginning with the 2009:Q2 survey, we extended the annual forecast horizon by two years for the civilian unemployment rate and real GDP. Beginning with the 2009:Q3 survey, we extended the annual forecast horizon by two years for the three-month Treasury bill rate and 10-year Treasury bond rate. For these four variables, the letters “A,” “B,” “C,” and “D” represent annual-average forecasts for the current year and the next three years.

20
File Structure: Example. Table 3 gives an example of the forecast horizons included at three successive quarterly survey dates: 2005:Q3, 2005:Q4, and 2006:Q1. In the survey conducted in the third quarter of 2005, the forecasters knew the BEA’s advance estimate for 2005:Q2, and they provided quarterly forecasts for 2005:Q3 through 2006:Q3. Their projection for 2005:Q3 is a forecast for the current quarter because that is the quarter in which the forecasters are standing when they make their projections. (Some call this the onestep-ahead forecast while others call it the 0-step-ahead forecast or the nowcast.) The forecasters’ annual-average projections were those for 2005 and 2006.
Note two features about the format of our files. First, as you move down a particular column, you get the sequence of a given step-ahead forecast. For example, the column labeled NGDP2 gives the sequence of current-quarter (or nowcast) forecasts. The column labeled NGDP6 gives the sequence of 5-step-ahead forecasts (if you count NGDP2 as the one-stepahead forecast). Be careful about these sequences! The forecasts for levels are always scaled to the base year that was in effect at the time of the survey. Over time, as benchmark revisions to the data occur, the scale changes. (Below, we provide additional information on base years.)
Second, the years included in the annual forecast horizon (“A” and “B”) change in each firstquarter survey. In the surveys conducted from 2005:Q1 through 2005:Q4, for example, the forecasters provided annual-average projections for the current year (2005) and the next year (2006). In the survey of 2006:Q1, the current year is 2006 and the next year is 2007, so the forecasters provided projections for those years. As noted below in the section on probability forecasts, similar comments apply to the annual forecast horizons for the survey’s density projections for annual-average over annual-average growth in the level of real GDP (variable: PRGDP) and the level of the GDP price index (variable: PRPGDP), the survey’s density projections for fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter growth in the level of the core CPI price index (variable: PRCCPI) and the fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter growth in the level of the core PCE price index (variable: PRCPCE), and the survey’s density projections for the annual-average level of the unemployment rate (variable: PRUNEMP).

Table notes. The table shows how we organize the survey’s median (or mean) responses for three survey dates: 2005:Q3, 2005:Q4, and 2006:Q1. The entries in columns (1)–(2) show the year and quarter when we conducted the survey. The entry in column (3) shows the observation date for the last known historical quarter at the time we sent the questionnaire to the panelists. The entries in columns (4)–(8) show the quarterly observation dates forecast. The entries in columns (9)–(10) show the annual observation dates forecast: Notice how the annual-average forecast horizons are fixed within a calendar year and change in each first-quarter survey. Moody’s now views the historical values for the Aaa and Baa corporate bond yields (BOND and BAABOND) as proprietary. Accordingly, the Philadelphia Fed is not permitted to release these historical values to the public.

At each survey date, we record the projections for various horizons in the same row. NGDP1 is the real-time quarterly historical value for the previous quarter—that is, the quarter before the quarter when we conducted the survey. NGDP2 is the forecast (nowcast) for the current quarter—that is, the quarter when we conducted the survey. NGDP3 to NGDP6 are the forecasts for the following four quarters. NGDPA and NGDPB are the annual-average projections for the current year (the year when we conducted the survey) and the following year.

22

Changes in Base Year. There have been a number of changes of base year in NIPA since the survey began. As noted above, the forecasts for levels in our data set use the base year that was in effect when we sent the forecasters the survey questionnaire. In particular, we do not rescale the forecasts of previous surveys when there is a change in base year. Table 4 provides the base year in effect for NIPA variables for each range of survey dates. The base year for the survey’s forecasts for industrial production has also changed over time. These base years appear in Table 5.

Caveats: Breaks in the Historical Series of Projections and Additional Information for Selected Variables. The historical time series in this survey are quite lengthy. A limited number of series are subject to some discontinuities. This section documents these breaks and provides additional information for selected variables.
• Moody’s Corporate Aaa Bond Yield (BOND). This variable is inconsistent before 1990:Q4. Prior to the survey of 1990:Q4, the variable used was the new, high-grade corporate bond yield (Business Conditions Digest variable 116.) This rate was generated at the U.S. Treasury primarily for internal use. The advantage of using it beginning in 1981:Q3 was that it was readily available. But many forecasters did not track this variable and, instead, sent in forecasts of closely related variables, such as Moody’s Aaa bond rate. The levels of these other variables may have differed by as much as 50 basis points. To eliminate this problem, we switched to using Moody’s Aaa bond rate in 1990:Q4, and now the forecasts are consistent. Moody’s now views the historical values for the Aaa and Baa corporate bond yields (BOND and BAABOND) as proprietary. Accordingly, the Philadelphia Fed is not permitted to release these historical values to the public.
• Moody’s Corporate Baa Bond Yield (BAABOND). Moody’s now views the historical values for the Aaa and Baa corporate bond yields (BOND and BAABOND) as proprietary. Accordingly, the Philadelphia Fed is not permitted to release these historical values to the public.
• Corporate Profits (CPROF). This variable is inconsistent before 2006:Q1. Prior to the survey of 2006:Q1, it is corporate profits after tax excluding IVA and CCAdj. The historical values of this particular measure are subject to large discrete jumps when there is a change in tax law affecting depreciation provisions. The time series of projections for this series in the Survey of Professional Forecasters may or may not capture the jumps in historical values, depending on whether the forecasters anticipated the corresponding changes in tax law. Beginning with the survey of 2006:Q1, we switched to the after-tax measure that includes IVA and CCAdj.
• Small Sample in the Survey of 1990:Q2. The Philadelphia Fed took over the survey in the summer of 1990. We were too late to send out a survey in 1990:Q2. However, to avoid having a missing data point, we mailed a 1990:Q2 survey form along with the 1990:Q3 survey form. We asked that only those who had a written record of their forecasts of three months earlier fill out the 1990:Q2 survey. As a result, the number of respondents was only nine. We felt that even a small, after-the-fact sample was better than no sample at all.
• Problem with Annual Forecasts and Probability Forecasts—Surveys 1985:Q1, 1986:Q1, and 1990:Q1. Generally, annual forecasts pertain to the current year and the following year. However, an error was made in the first-quarter surveys of 1985 and 1986. In those quarters, for the first 19 variables listed above (excluding EMP), the first annual forecast is for the previous year and the second annual forecast is for the current year. However, we cannot be sure from the NBER’s records whether the

24
same is true for the probability variables PRGDP and PRPGDP. In addition, in the first quarter of 1990, for the same variables listed above, the same error was made, so that the first annual forecast is for the previous year and the second annual forecast is for the current year. The probability variables were done correctly in that survey, so they pertain to the current year and the following year.
• Real GNP prior to the Survey of 1981:Q3. The survey did not ask the panelists to forecast this variable prior to the survey of 1981:Q3. In order to provide a longer time series for this variable, we compute real GNP from 1968:Q4 to 1981:Q2 by using the formula NGDP / PGDP * 100. We compute the implied forecast for each panelist, then the means and medians.
• Long-Term Forecasts for the Yield on 10-Year Constant-Maturity Treasury Bonds (BOND10). Beginning with the survey of 2014:Q1, we changed the way in which we ask the forecasters for their long-term (10-year annual average) forecast for the yield on 10-year constant-maturity Treasury bonds. We made the change because the question had always been ambiguously phrased. Such ambiguity might produce difficulties in interpreting the survey’s responses. This change may or may not affect the way in which the panelists answer the question. Note that this variable (BOND10) enters the survey only in the first quarter of the year. However, each quarter the survey asks for short-term projections for the 10-year Treasury rate.
o In first-quarter surveys prior to that of 2014:Q1: We asked the forecasters for their expectation of the “annual average over the next 10 years of the return to 10-year Treasury bonds.” This could mean: (1) the return to buying a 10-year Treasury bond on the survey date and holding it until maturity; or (2) the 10year average return to buying a 10-year Treasury bond every day (or month or quarter) over the next 10 years and holding each bond until maturity. [The second interpretation is somewhat more consistent with the survey’s overall design because the SPF has always asked for quarterly projections for the 10year Treasury rate (nowcast and next four quarters) and annual-average projections (current year and future years).]
o In first-quarter surveys beginning with that of 2014:Q1: We ask the forecasters for their expectation of the “annual average yield on 10-year constant-maturity Treasury bonds over the next 10 years.” We also make it clear that we mean the average of a panelist’s projections for the current year and the following nine years and that the long-term survey projection should be consistent with the short-term survey projection for the current year and the following three years.

3. Growth Rates: Median and Mean Forecasts and Technical Definitions

Median and Mean Forecasts for Growth Rates.
Two files contain median and mean forecasts for growth of selected survey variables: MedianGrowth.xlsx and MeanGrowth.xlsx. We construct these forecast growth rates by first computing the median or mean forecast for the level of the variable (X), as given in MedianLevel.xlsx and MeanLevel.xlsx. We then compute the rate of growth (g), using the formula

= gˆt+k |t−1



Xˆ t+k |t−1 Xˆ t+k −1| t−1

4= −1 , k

0,1,, 4

where gˆt+k |t−1 represents the forecast for quarter-over-quarter growth in period t + k made on the basis of observations known through period t −1, and Xˆ t+k |t−1 represents the
corresponding mean or median forecast for the level. Our notation makes use of the fact that a survey is conducted in quarter t , and the forecasters make their projections on the basis of
historical observations dated t −1 and earlier. The (quarterly) projections are for periods t,t +1,,t + 4. Thus, when k = 0 , we have the forecast for growth in the current quarter, the quarter in which the survey was conducted. As explained above, Xˆ t−1|t−1 = Xt−1 , where Xt−1
represents the historical value for the quarter before the survey quarter, as reported by government statistical agencies at the time the survey questionnaire is sent to the forecasters.6
Caveat. Note that the discussion of this sub-section excludes the forecasts for the headline and core CPI price index and the headline and core PCE price index. For these variables, the panelists submit their projections in growth-rate form only (that is, for inflation rates). Hence, the survey’s median and mean projections for CPI and PCE inflation are means and medians of a growth rate (inflation), not growth rates of the mean and median projection for the level of the price index.
An Example. Forecast growth rates are computed from the forecasts for levels in the files, MedianLevel.xlsx and MeanLevel.xlsx. Using the nomenclature for these files developed above, we can write the forecast for growth for nominal GDP in the current quarter and the next quarter as

6 The forecasters are permitted to forecast a revision to the last quarter of history ( X t−1) . Most do not. Thus, in almost all cases, Xˆ t−1| t−1 = X t−1.

The format of our files of forecast growth rates parallels that described above for the forecasts of levels. Here are some noteworthy features:
• We provide forecast growth rates for the following variables: nominal GNP/GDP (NGDP), GNP/GDP price index (PGDP), corporate profits (CPROF), nonfarm payroll employment (EMP), industrial production index (INDPROD), housing starts (HOUSING), real GNP/GDP (RGDP), real personal consumption expenditures (RCONSUM), real nonresidential fixed investment (RNRESIN), real residential fixed investment (RRESINV), real federal government consumption and gross investment (RFEDGOV), and real state and local government consumption and gross investment (RSLGOV).
• Growth rates are those for quarter-over-quarter growth, expressed in annualized percentage points, beginning with the forecast for the current quarter.
• Each worksheet lists the year and quarter in which the survey was conducted.
• The column headers in each worksheet follow the same nomenclature described above. (We use “d” in the column header to denote a growth rate.) In particular, the number “2” appended to a column header represents a forecast for the quarter in which the survey is conducted. The numbers “3” to “6” represent the quarter-overquarter growth rate forecasts for the following four quarters.
• Two worksheets are associated with the forecasts for the level of nonfarm payroll employment (EMP): EMP_AVG and EMP_PCG. The first (EMP_AVG) gives the implied forecast for the per month flow of new jobs, defined as the first difference of the forecast for the quarterly average level, divided by three. The second (EMP_PCG) gives the forecast growth rate, in annualized percentage points.

27

Technical Definitions of Growth Rates.

The survey includes forecasts for quarterly, quarter-over-quarter growth rates and for annual growth rates. A number of critical points are worth noting at the outset about these forecasts for growth rates:

• For all variables except headline and core CPI inflation and headline and core PCE inflation: The survey’s official growth rates are those for the rate of growth of the mean or median forecast for the level. That is, the survey’s reported growth rate is the rate of growth of the mean or median forecast for the level, not the mean or median forecast for the growth rate.

• For headline and core CPI inflation and headline and core PCE inflation: The official growth rate (that is, inflation itself) is the mean or median forecast for the inflation rate itself.

• All growth rates are expressed in annualized percentage points. The formulas use discrete compounding, not continuous compounding.

We use the preceding critical points to motivate the following general mathematical definitions for growth rates in the survey. Researchers and business analysts should keep these definitions in mind for understanding the survey’s results and also for computing the realizations associated with the forecasts.

Quarterly, Quarter-over-Quarter Growth Rates. Let Xt represent the quarterly-average level of a variable in the quarter indexed by t .

It also includes the survey’s implied forecasts for real interest rates through the term for expected inflation.

29
• Headline and core CPI inflation and headline and core PCE inflation.
• The random variables behind the density projections for core CPI inflation (PRCCPI) and core PCE inflation (PRCPCE).
Long-Term Growth Rates. The survey also includes projections for five-year and/or 10year annual-average projections for real GDP growth (RGDP10), productivity growth (PROD 10), and CPI and PCE inflation (CPI5YR, PCE5YR, CPI10, PCE10). Some important points to note about these long-term projections are:
• We do not tell the forecasters the formulas to use for these long-term projections.
• For 10-year annual-average growth in real GDP and productivity, we assume the forecasters use the geometric average of the annual-average over annual-average calculation described above. That is, we assume the forecasters chain together 10 forecasts for annual-average over annual-average growth.
• For five- and 10-year annual-average CPI and PCE inflation, we have a good reason to believe the forecasters use the fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter calculation described above, at least in the surveys we conducted starting with the one for 2011:Q1. (The reason is that the 2011:Q1 survey questionnaire is the first one in which we began to provide automatic checks in the survey questionnaire allowing the forecasters to examine the internal consistency across their one-, two-, and threeyear ahead annual fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter inflation projections and their five- and 10-year annual-average inflation projections. Because the annual projections use the fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter formula, we assume the check for internal consistency implicitly forces a fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter calculation on the panelists’ projections for long-term inflation.)

Rules vs. Discretion: How Do We Know the Panelists Use the Correct Formulas?
In short, we do not know with certainty that the SPF panelists are following our rules for growth rates. They may well be using their own discretion on the appropriate form of the growth rate. However, for the reasons listed below, we strongly believe most panelists follow our rules.
• Our procedures for processing survey returns include running a number of checks for the internal consistency of each panelist’s projections. Among these checks are ones for the appropriate growth rates.
• If we suspect a panelist is not following our rules, we will contact the panelist and discuss our concerns.
• Prior to a new panelist entering the survey, we send an information packet that includes, among other items, a document (available on the Philadelphia Fed’s web page for the survey) entitled “Data Sources and Descriptions.” That document describes the variables in the survey as well as the growthrate transformations. Each year, we resend “Data Sources and Descriptions” to all forecasters on the panel.
• The survey questionnaire itself is quite explicit in describing the appropriate growth rates. (Examples of the questionnaire are available on the Philadelphia Fed’s web page for the survey.)

4. Forecasts of Individual Participants
An Excel workbook with multiple worksheets contains the individual responses of the forecasters: SPFmicrodata.xlsx. Each worksheet in the workbook covers the surveys of a different variable from 1968:Q4 to present.
With three exceptions, these worksheets are organized in the same manner described above for the files of median and mean responses:
• First Exception. The first exception is that we include an additional column giving the forecaster’s confidential identification number (ID). This column appears after the columns giving the year and quarter in which the survey was conducted. The identification numbers are consistent over time, allowing you to trace a given forecaster’s responses from one survey to the next. See the section below for some caveats on using individual identification numbers.
• Second Exception. The second exception is that we include another column giving the forecaster’s industry classification (INDUSTRY). This column appears after the columns giving the year, quarter, and individual identification number. Each forecaster in each survey (1990:Q2 to present) is assigned a “1,” “2,” or “3” for the industry classification depending on whether he works in a firm that we characterize as a financial service provider (“1”) or a nonfinancial service provider (“2”). A value of “3” is used when we don’t know the industry. A forecaster’s classification can change when he changes his affiliation. In other words, we track the forecaster’s classification in real time. See the section below for more information on the INDUSTRY column.
• Third Exception. The third exception is that we include six additional worksheet tabs in the workbook: PRGDP, PRPGDP, PRUNEMP, PRCCPI, PRCPCE, and RECESS.
o The worksheet (variable) PRGDP gives the probability that the annualaverage over annual-average percent change in GDP falls in a particular range. The percent changes are computed from the forecasts for annualaverage levels.
o The worksheet PRPGDP gives the probability that the annual-average over annual-average percent change in GDP price index falls in a particular range. The percent changes are computed from the forecasts for annual-average levels.
Please note that these two worksheets (PRGDP and PRPGDP) contain data that are very tricky to work with because: (1) the ranges change over time, (2) the number of annual forecast horizons changes over time, and (3) in early surveys, the output variable was nominal output, not real output. A section below discusses these points in detail.

32
o The worksheet PRUNEMP gives the probabilities that the annual average of the civilian unemployment rate falls in a particular range.
o The worksheet PRCCPI gives the probability that the fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter percent change in core CPI falls in a particular range. Please note that these probability ranges are for growth in the current year (the year in which the survey was conducted) and the following year, as shown in Table 9.
o The worksheet PRCPCE gives the probability that the fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter percent change in core PCE falls in a particular range. Please note that these probability ranges are for growth in the current year (the year in which the survey was conducted) and the following year, as shown in Table 9.
o The worksheet RECESS gives the probability of a decline in the level of real GDP in the current quarter and the following four quarters. These are declines in the level of real GDP from one quarter to the next, beginning with a decline in the current quarter (the quarter in which the survey was conducted) compared with the quarter prior.
Caveats on Using the Individual Identification Numbers.
As noted above, we code the data set of individual responses with an identification number for each forecaster. In principle, this identifier allows you to track an individual’s responses over time. However, for two reasons, users of these data should exercise some caution in interpreting the identifiers:
• First, in the surveys conducted by the ASA/NBER, the same identification number could represent different forecasters. In these surveys, we have noticed some occurrences in which an individual participates, suddenly drops out of the panel for a large number of periods, and suddenly re-enters, suggesting that the same identifier might have been assigned to different forecasters. Unfortunately, we cannot investigate the historical record of these individuals because we do not have hardcopy historical records from the early surveys.
• Second, in the surveys conducted by the Philadelphia Fed, it can be difficult to assign an identification number to an individual who changes his place of employment but remains in the survey. The question is: Should the identification number follow the individual or should it remain with the original firm? Over the years, we have tried to use the following guideline in deciding: If a forecast seems associated more with the firm than the individual, the identification number stays with the firm, and we assign a new identification number to the individual. If the forecast seems more clearly associated with the panelist, the identification number follows the panelist to his new place of employment.

33
INDUSTRY Classification.
In the second half of 2007, we searched our computer files and hard-copy records to retroactively classify the industry with which each panelist is affiliated, beginning with the survey in 1990:Q2 (the first SPF conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia). Loosely speaking, we code the industry as a “1” for a financial service provider, “2” for a nonfinancial service provider, and “3” if we are uncertain. We took a very conservative approach in assigning 1’s and 2’s: we use “1” or “2” only when we are very certain. If we do not know the firm at which the panelist is employed, we code the INDUSTRY variables as “3.” Even when we know the firm, we sometimes code INDUSTRY as “3” if we have no information about the firm. Below, we list examples of the types of firms that we code as “1” or “2.”
We assign a “1” to the following list of financial service providers:
1. Insurance 2. Investment Banking 3. Commercial Banking 4. Payment Services 5. Hedge Funds 6. Mutual Funds 7. Association of Financial Service Providers 8. Asset Management
We assign a “2” to the following list of nonfinancial service providers:
1. Manufacturers 2. Universities 3. Forecasting Firms 4. Investment Advisors 5. Pure Research Firms 6. Consulting Firms

5. One-Year-Ahead and 10-Year-Ahead Inflation Forecasts

The file Inflation.xlsx contains expectations for one-year-ahead annual-average inflation, measured either by the GDP price index (INFPGDP1YR) or the CPI (INFCPI1YR), and expectations for the annual-average rate of CPI inflation over the next 10 years (INFCPI10YR).

The two one-year-ahead series are expectations for average inflation over the four quarters following the quarter when we conducted the survey. We compute these series from the underlying median forecasts in the following manner:

• For INFPGDP1YR, we use the forecasts for the level of the price index in the columns PGDP2 and PGDP6 of the worksheet PGDP in the workbook MedianLevel.xlsx.

• For INFCPI1YR, we use the geometric average of the quarter-over-quarter median forecasts for CPI inflation, corresponding to the columns CPI3 to CPI6 of the worksheet CPI in the same workbook.

The formulas are given by:

The formulas differ—even though they measure a rate of change in the same way—because the forecasters provide their projections for the GDP price index in levels, but they report their forecasts for the CPI as quarter-over-quarter growth rates.

6. Mean Probability Forecasts
The file Prob.xlsx contains the mean responses for the survey’s six probability variables in the following worksheets:
• PRGDP. The worksheet PRGDP gives the mean responses for the probabilities that the annual-average over annual-average percent change in the level of chainweighted real GDP falls into a number of alternative ranges. The probabilities sum to 100 (up to a rounding error).
Note a number of technical details. First, the annual-average over annual-average percent change is defined as the percent change in the annual-average level from one year to the next, where the annual-average level is the average of the quarterly levels over the four quarters of a calendar year. Second, the probability estimates are for fixed event forecasts: In each quarterly survey of a given calendar year, the panelists provide their probability estimates for annual-average over annual-average growth in the current year (defined as the year in which we conducted the survey) and the following years. Third, over 1992 to 1995, the survey uses fixed-weighted real GDP. Surveys prior to 1992 use fixed-weighted real GNP.
• PRPGDP. The worksheet PRPGDP gives the mean responses for the probabilities that the annual-average over annual-average percent change in the level of the GDP chain-weighted price index falls into a number of alternative ranges. The probabilities sum to 100 (up to a rounding error). The technical details are as described above for PRGDP. Over 1992 to 1995, the survey uses the implicit deflator for GDP. Surveys prior to 1992 use the implicit deflator for GNP.
• PRCCPI. The worksheet PRCCPI gives the mean responses for the probabilities that the fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter percent change in the level of the core CPI price index falls into a number of alternative ranges. The probabilities sum to 100 (up to a rounding error).
Note a number of technical details. First, the fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter percent change is defined as the percent change in the fourth-quarter level from one year to the next, where the fourth-quarter level is the average of the monthly levels over the three months of the fourth quarter. Second, the probability estimates are for fixed event forecasts: In each quarterly survey of a given calendar year, the panelists provide their probability estimates for fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter growth in the current year (defined as the year in which we conducted the survey) and the following years.
Note also an important difference in the way that the probability ranges are defined for PRGDP and PRPGDP on the one hand and for PRCCPI (and PRCPCE) on the other. For PRGDP and PRPGDP, the probability ranges are for growth in the annualaverage level of GDP and the GDP price index. For PRCCPI (and PRCPCE), the ranges are for fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter growth.

36
• PRCPCE. The worksheet PRCPCE gives the mean responses for the probabilities that the fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter percent change in the level of the chainweighted core PCE price index falls into a number of alternative ranges. The technical details are as described above for PRCCPI.
Note an important difference in the way that the probability ranges are defined for PRGDP and PRPGDP on the one hand and for PRCCPI and PRCPCE on the other. For PRGDP and PRPGDP, the probability ranges are for growth in the annualaverage level of GDP and the GDP price index. For PRCCPI and PRCPCE, the ranges are for fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter growth.
• PRUNEMP. The worksheet PRUNEMP gives the mean responses for the probabilities that the annual average of the civilian unemployment rate falls into a number of alternative ranges.
Note a number of technical details. First, the annual-average unemployment rate is the arithmetic average of the level of the unemployment rate over the 12 months of the year. Second, the probability estimates are for fixed event forecasts: In each quarterly survey of a given calendar year, the panelists provide their probability estimates for the annual-average unemployment rate in the current year (defined as the year in which we conducted the survey) and the following years.
• RECESS. The worksheet RECESS gives the mean responses for the probability of a decline in the level of chain-weighted real GDP in the current quarter and the following four quarters. These are declines in the level of chain-weighted real GDP from one quarter to the next, beginning with a decline in the current quarter (the quarter in which the survey was conducted) compared with the quarter prior. Over 1992 to 1995, the survey uses fixed-weighted real GDP. Surveys prior to 1992 use fixed-weighted real GNP.
Probabilities: Additional Comments on PRGDP and PRPGDP.
Note that, conceptually, the percent changes for these two variables are those for the annualaverage levels. These two worksheets contain data that are very tricky to work with because:
• The ranges change over time. • The number of annual forecast horizons changes over time. • In early surveys, the output variable was nominal output, not real output.
Some details follow. The variable PRGDP is the mean probability that the percent change in GDP falls in a particular range. From 1968:Q4 to 1981:Q2, this was the probability of nominal GNP falling in a particular range, while from 1981:Q3 to 1991:Q4, this variable refers to real GNP. From 1992:Q1 on, this variable refers to real GDP. Thus, over the entire history of the survey, this variable has switched from nominal to real and GNP to GDP. The variable PRPGDP is the mean probability that the percent change in the price index for GDP

37
(for GNP prior to 1992:Q1) falls in a particular range. The ranges for both these variables have changed over time.
Major changes in these probability distribution questions occurred in the 1981:Q3 and 1992:Q1 surveys. The old version (prior to 1981:Q3) asked for the probability attached to each of 15 possible percent changes in nominal GNP and the implicit deflator, usually from the previous year to the current year. The new version (1981:Q3 on) asks for percent changes in real GNP and the implicit deflator, usually for the current and following year. However, there are only six categories for each of the two years, instead of the 15 categories in the old version. Then, in 1992:Q1, the number of categories was changed to 10 for each of the two years, and output was changed from GNP to GDP. In 2009:Q2, the number of categories was changed to 11 and two additional years of annual forecast were added. In 2020:Q2, changes were made to the probability bins for PRGDP, but the number of categories remained at 11. As noted above, the probability variables prior to 1981:Q3 usually referred to percent changes for the current year. From 1981:Q3 on, the two probability variables usually refer to the current year and the following year. However, there are some exceptions. In certain surveys prior to 1981:Q3, most often in the fourth quarter, the probability variables referred to the percent change in nominal GNP and the deflator in the following year, rather than the current year. The surveys for which this is true are 1968:Q4, 1969:Q4, 1970:Q4, 1971:Q4, 1972:Q3–Q4, 1973:Q4, 1975:Q4, 1976:Q4, 1977:Q4, 1978:Q4, and 1979:Q2–Q4. (For example, the probability ranges in the 1968:Q4 survey should pertain to growth in 1968, but in fact the survey asked about probabilities for growth in 1969.)
In addition, we are uncertain about the years referred to in the surveys of the first quarters of 1985 and 1986 and have not found documentation that can confirm our suspicion that the years do not follow the standard of the current year and the following year. For surveys since 1990:Q2 (when the Philadelphia Fed took over the survey), the probability ranges always pertain to the current year and the following year.
Tables 6 and 7 show how the ranges have changed over the years.
Probabilities: Additional Comments on PRCCPI and PRCPCE.
These two variables were added to the survey in 2007:Q1. Note that the percent changes for these two variables are measured in fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter growth rates of the price indices. Table 8 shows the probability ranges for PRCCPI and PRCPCE.
Probabilities: Additional Comments on PRUNEMP.
This variable was added to the survey in 2009:Q2. It is the probability that unemployment will fall into each of 10 ranges. In 2014:Q1 and 2020:Q2, changes were made to the probability bins for PRUNEMP. Table 9 shows the probability ranges for PRUNEMP.

38
Probabilities: Additional Comments on RECESS.
The variable RECESS is the probability of a decline in real GDP (real GNP prior to 1992:Q1) in the current quarter and the following four quarters. We label these RECESS1 to RECESS5. Please note that this is the probability of a decline in the level of real GDP from one quarter to the next. RECESS1, for example, refers to a decline in the current quarter from the previous quarter, and RECESS2 refers to a quarter-over-quarter decline in the next quarter. This is sometimes hard to explain to users of the data, but we can provide precise content with the following probability statements, using the nomenclature established above for the quarterly forecasts for the level of real GDP:
( ) = Recess1t Prob RGDP2 t < RGDP1t ( ) = Recess2 t Prob RGDP3 t < RGDP2 t

( ) = Recess5 t Prob RGDP6 t < RGDP5 t
where Prob ( x) is the probability of event x, and RGDP2 to RGDP6 are the quarterly
forecasts for the level of real GDP in the current quarter (RGDP2) and the next four quarters. RGDP1 refers, of course, to the historical value for the quarter before the quarter in which the survey is conducted.

7. Presentation of Data by Individual Variable
In September 2008, we published an alternative way of presenting the SPF data on our website. The new arrangement presents the SPF data by individual variable. On the main index page (https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/data-files), we group the data files into ten sub-groups:
• U.S. Business Indicators • Real GDP and Its Components • CPI and PCE Inflation • Long-Term Inflation Forecasts • Additional Long-Term Forecasts • Equilibrium Unemployment • Probability on Ranges • Probability of Decline in Real GNP/GDP • Anxious Index • Implied Forecasts
This arrangement lets researchers find a particular variable quickly. Each SPF variable has its own web page to let users select the individual, mean, median, mean growth, or median growth responses for that particular variable. For example, by choosing the link Nominal Gross National Product/Gross Domestic Product (NGDP) from the main index page, a user can browse the page for NGDP (https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/ngdp) and select the desired data. For some variables, we also provide links to the real-time data and the forecast error statistics.

46
8. Natural Rate of Unemployment
In third-quarter surveys, we ask the forecasters to provide their estimates of the natural rate of unemployment (UBAR). An important part of the analysis is the breakdown of the responses into two groups: (1) those who use the natural rate concept in preparing their forecasts, and (2) those who do not. The variable “DUMMY_UBAR” is coded as “1” for those who use the concept and “0” for those who do not. The variable “UBAR” is used to record the natural rate forecasts. Our newsletter reports the median response for those who use the concept. Note also that our files of mean and median responses, measures of dispersion, and individual responses use only the responses of those panelists who tell us that they use the natural rate of unemployment in preparing their projections.
In October 2008, we added a new UBAR worksheet tab to each of the following Excel files:
1. Micro1.xlsx, Micro2.xlsx, Micro3.xlsx, Micro4.xlsx, and Micro5.xlsx for individual responses.
In October 2019, we combined the five individual responses files (Micro1.xlsx to Micro5.xlsx) into a single file, SPFmicrodata.xlsx.
2. MedianLevel.xlsx and MeanLevel.xlsx for means and medians responses.
We have also produced three additional Excel files for the UBAR variable:
1. Individual_UBAR.xlsx 2. Mean_UBAR_Level.xlsx 3. Median_UBAR_Level.xlsx

9. Cross-Sectional Forecast Dispersion
We organize the files for cross-sectional measures of forecast dispersion in two ways: by dispersion measure and by individual variable.
Dispersion: Files Organized by Measure of Dispersion.
The files Dispersion_1.xlsx, Dispersion_2.xlsx, and Dispersion_3.xlsx contain the crosssectional forecast dispersion for selected survey variables. Each file corresponds to a different measure of dispersion. The three files are organized in the same manner. Each is an Excel workbook containing multiple worksheets, with each worksheet containing the forecast dispersion for a particular variable. You move among the worksheets by choosing the appropriate tab at the bottom. These tabs refer to the variable being forecast. The first column in each worksheet gives the year and quarter in which the survey was conducted. The remaining columns give the 25th percentile, the 75th percentile, and the forecast dispersion for current quarter (T) and the following four quarters (T+1, …, T+4).
Please note that not all dispersion measures are available for each survey variable. In particular, we avoid measures that are influenced by arbitrary changes in the scale of the data, such as those that arise when the base year changes in a benchmark revision.
For most survey variables, we use “level” to refer to the level of the variable — for example, the level of real GDP in chain-weighted dollars. However, for CPI and PCE inflation, we define the level as a quarter-over-quarter (Q/Q) growth rate, in annualized percentage points, because the forecasters provide their projections for these variables in growth rates.
We construct Dispersion_1.xlsx by first computing the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile of the forecasts for the level of the variable (X). We then compute dispersion measure D1 as the difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile, using the formula
= X _ D1t+k |t−1 Xˆ= _ P75 _ D1t+k |t−1 − Xˆ _ P25 _ D1t+k |t−1, k 0,1,, 4
where X _ D1t+k |t−1 represents the inter-quartile forecast dispersion for the level of the
variable X in period t + k made on the basis of observations known through period t −1, and
Xˆ _P 75 _ D1t+k |t−1 and Xˆ _P 25 _ D1t+k |t−1 represent the corresponding 75th and 25th percentiles for the level forecasts. Our notation makes use of the fact that a survey is conducted in quarter t , and the forecasters make their projections on the basis of historical observations
dated t −1 and earlier.
We construct Dispersion_2.xlsx by first computing the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile of the projections for Q/Q growth (in annualized percentage points) of the variable (X). We then compute dispersion measure D2 as the difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile of the Q/Q growth forecasts, using the formula

48
= X _ D2t+k |t−1 Xˆ= _ P75 _ D2t+k |t−1 − Xˆ _ P25 _ D2t+k |t−1, k 0,1,, 4
where X _ D2t+k |t−1 represents the inter-quartile forecast dispersion for the Q/Q growth of the
variable X in period t + k made on the basis of observations known through period t −1, and
Xˆ _ P75 _ D2t+k |t−1 and Xˆ _ P25 _ D2t+k |t−1 represent the corresponding 75th and 25th percentiles for the Q/Q growth forecasts.
We construct Dispersion_3.xlsx by first computing the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile for the level of the variable (X). We then compute dispersion measure D3 as the percent difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile of the projections in levels, using the formula
= X _ D3t+k |t−1 Xˆ= _ P75 _ D3t+k |t−1 − Xˆ _ P25 _ D3t+k |t−1, k 0,1,, 4
where X _ D3t+k |t−1 represents the inter-quartile forecast dispersion for the percent difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile of the projections in level of
the variable X in period t + k made on the basis of observations known through period t −1,
and Xˆ _ P75 _ D3t+k |t−1 and Xˆ _ P25 _ D3t+k |t−1 represent the corresponding natural logarithms of the 75th and 25th percentiles for the level multiplied by 100.
Dispersion: Files Organized by Individual Variable.
We also construct an alternative way of presenting the forecast dispersion data. In this arrangement, each SPF variable has its own file (Excel workbook) to let users select different measures of cross-sectional forecast dispersion (D1, D2, and D3) for that particular variable. Each Excel workbook contains up to three worksheets, with each worksheet containing a different dispersion measure for a particular variable. You move among the worksheets by choosing the appropriate tab at the bottom. These tabs refer to the D1, D2, and D3 measures of dispersion (described above). The first column in each worksheet gives the year and quarter in which the survey was conducted. The remaining columns give the 25th percentile, the 75th percentile, and the forecast dispersion for the current quarter (T) and the following four quarters (T+1, …, T+4).
Please note that not all dispersion measures are available for each survey variable. In particular, we avoid measures that are influenced by arbitrary changes in the scale of the data, such as those that arise when the base year changes in a benchmark revision.
For most survey variables, we use the “level” to refer to the level of the variable — for example, the level of real GDP in chain-weighted dollars. However, for CPI and PCE inflation, we define the level as a quarter-over-quarter (Q/Q) growth rate, in annualized percentage points, because the forecasters provide their projections for these variables in growth rates.

49
Caveat on the Use of 25th and 75th Percentiles for Quarter-over-Quarter Growth
Please note that the method for constructing the 25th and 75th percentiles of quarter-over-quarter growth rates differs from the method we use to construct the survey’s official projections for growth.
To construct the 25th and the 75th percentiles for growth, we first compute the growth rates for each panelist from his forecast for the level of a variable. We then compute the percentiles.
To construct the survey’s official measures for mean and median growth, we first compute the mean and median forecast for the level of the variable. We then compute the rate of growth of the mean or median level. In other words, the survey’s official measures for growth are the rate of growth of the mean or median level, not the mean or median growth rate.
This caveat on 25th and 75th percentiles applies to the following SPF variables, for which panelists submit their projections for levels. For these variables, you should not plot the survey’s official measures for growth with the 25th and 75th percentiles. Such a plot could be misleading.
• Nominal Gross National Product/Gross Domestic Product (NGDP) • Price Index for Gross National Product/Gross Domestic Product (PGDP) • Corporate Profits After Tax (CPROF) • Nonfarm Payroll Employment (EMP) • Industrial Production Index (INDPROD) • Housing Starts (HOUSING) • Real Gross National Product/Gross Domestic Product (RGDP) • Real Personal Consumption Expenditures (RCONSUM) • Real Nonresidential Fixed Investment (RNRESIN) • Real Residential Fixed Investment (RRESINV) • Real Federal Government Consumption Expenditures & Gross Investment (RFEDGOV) • Real State and Local Government Consumption Expenditures & Gross Investment
(RSLGOV)
This caveat does not apply to the following SPF variables because the forecasters provide their projections for these variables in growth-rate form only. Thus, the survey’s official measures for growth may be compared with the 25th and 75th percentiles.
• Headline and core CPI inflation (CPI, CORECPI) • Headline and core PCE inflation (PCE, COREPCE) • 10-year annual-average projections for growth, including 10-year annual-average
inflation projections • Five-year annual-average inflation projections • Five-year forward, five-year annual-average inflation projections

50
10. Implied Forecasts
Overview. In August 2012, we released the projections for 21 new variables. These new variables do not appear directly in the survey. Rather, we compute the projections as linear combinations of the forecasts for variables already in the survey. For this reason, we refer to the new projections as “implied forecasts.” We compute the implied forecasts for:
• Yield spreads, • Forward inflation rates, and • Real interest rates.
For the new variables listed below, we compute each panelist’s implied forecast at each survey date and forecast horizon. Then, for each survey, we compute the cross-sectional mean forecasts, the cross-sectional median forecasts, and measures of dispersion. (A previous section provides more information on measures of dispersion.)
Table 10 below describes the variables for which we compute implied forecasts.7

7 The discussion of this section covers the survey’s forecasts at quarterly horizons. The quarterly horizons cover the current quarter (that is, the quarter when we conduct the survey) and the four quarters following the current quarter. The survey also produces forecasts at annual horizons. (See “Median and Mean Forecasts for Levels” for more information on the annual forecast horizons.) The implied forecasts for yield spreads are available at these annual horizons.

Implied Forecasts: Computations. We begin by defining the existing survey variables that we use to construct the implied forecasts. These variables enter the survey directly. Table 11 below provides the definitions.

Now, let t index a quarterly survey date.

Also, let , xt+τ |t−1 τ = −1, 0,1,..., 4 denote a panelist’s forecast for the quarterly value that
variable x will take in period t +τ , as reported in the survey of period t , with quarterly historical values known through period t −1. (For simplicity, we suppress the use of
subscripts to distinguish one panelist’s projection from another’s.)

For example, xt |t−1 denotes the current-quarter forecast (or nowcast) for quarter t in the
survey of quarter t , and xt+1|t−1 denotes the corresponding forecast for the quarter after the
nowcast quarter. Note that xt−1 |t−1 represents the last quarter of history in the forecasters’ information set when they form their projections for the survey of period t . (As noted above, the forecasters are permitted to forecast a revision to the last quarterly historical value, but most do not.)

Computations for Yield Spreads. We compute each panelist’s implied forecasts using the formulas shown below. Then, for each survey and across all panelists, we compute the mean projections, the median projections, and measures of cross-section dispersion.

Computations for Real Interest Rates. We compute the projection for the nominal interest rate on three-month Treasury bills minus the projection for inflation. We do this first for each panelist, using the formulas shown below. Then, for each survey and across all panelists, we compute the mean projections, the median projections, and measures of cross-section dispersion.

Because there is not a perfect correspondence between the period covered by the interest rate and the period for inflation, we compute three measures of the real interest rate (RR1, RR2, and RR3). The measures differ according to the horizon for the inflation projection. The first measure subtracts the same-quarter inflation projection from the interest-rate projection. The second measure subtracts the one-quarter-ahead inflation projection. The third measure subtracts the average inflation projection (same quarter and one-quarter ahead) from the interest-rate projection.

Computations for Forward Inflation Rates. We use the survey’s projections for five-year annual-average inflation and 10-year annual-average inflation. (Note that the survey’s projections for five-year annual-average inflation cover the first five years of the 10-year horizon.)

We compute each panelist’s implied forecast for inflation over the second five years of the 10-year horizon, using the formulas shown below. Then, for each survey and across all panelists, we compute the mean projections, the median projections, and measures of crosssection dispersion.

Description of Change
INDUSTRY classification added in Section 4. Timing of the survey added in Section 1. Presentation of data by individual variable added in Section 7. Natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU) added in Section 8. Made minor changes to some narrative to reflect the BEA’s July 2009 benchmark revision to the national income and product accounts. Extended RGDP series back to 1968:Q4. Previously, RGDP started in 1981:Q3. Added Moody’s Baa corporate bond yield. Added two more years of annual forecasts for the civilian unemployment rate, three-month Treasury bill rate, 10-year Treasury bond rate, and real GDP. Added two additional years for probability of changes in real GDP. Added probability of civilian unemployment rates. The base year for the industrial production indexes changed from 2002 to 2007. Added a new section entitled “Cross-Sectional Forecast Dispersion.” Extended RGDPC, RGDPD, UNEMPC, UNEMPD, PRGDP1– PRGDP44, and PRUNEMP1–PRUNEMP40 series back to 2009:Q2. Previously, these series started in 2010:Q1. Extended TBILLC, TBILLD, TBONDC, and TBONDD series back to 2009:Q3. Previously, these series started in 2010:Q1. Added a new section entitled “Implied Forecasts.” Modified the bin definitions for PRPGDP and PRUNEMP. Added a new definition for the long-term projection for the 10year constant-maturity Treasury yield (BOND10). Updated Table 5 to indicate a new base year for industrial production, beginning with the survey of 2015:Q3. Added the 25th percentiles and the 75th percentiles to the files for cross-sectional forecast dispersion. Augmented our descriptions of the survey’s density projections (section 6, “Mean Probability Forecasts”). Added some clarifying language on growth rates throughout the documentation.

On May 12, 2017, the survey’s data files on the Bank’s website were changed to a .xlsx extension instead of .xls. We adjusted this document accordingly. Moody’s now views the historical values for the Aaa and Baa corporate bond yields (BOND and BAABOND) as proprietary. Accordingly, the Philadelphia Fed is not permitted to release these historical values to the public. Added additional clarifying details on many of the survey’s variables, most notably the natural rate of unemployment (UBAR) and the density projections for GDP and GDP prices (PRGDP, PRPGDP). Updated Table 4 to indicate a new base year for NIPA variables, beginning with the survey of 2018:Q3. Combined the five individual forecast files (Micro1.xlsx to Micro5.xlsx) into a single file, SPFmicrodata.xlsx.
Modified the bin definitions for PRGDP and PRUNEMP. Updated Table 5 to indicate a new base year for industrial production, beginning with the survey of 2021:Q3.
