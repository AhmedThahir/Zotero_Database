Abstract:
In modern days the margin of error for football game is low, therefore the ultimate aim of the game is to win the match. The performance of the players in the match affects the results of the game. Due to this it is very important to evaluate the player and know his weakness. Manual evaluation tends to generate many errors and take more time. In the current research the statistical model is proposed to predict the stats of the football player based on previous session data by considering various aspects of the game. Through literature reviews it is observed that machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be used predict the performance of football player. But which model would be more efficient considering the positions of the player is not considered in any article. The proposed model has designed separate model as per the position of the player during the game. This can help to predict the player's performance as per their playing position. The current study has successfully implemented various machine learning and deep learning models and provide comparative analysis of the same. Each position has considered different variables associated with that position. The performance of these models is compared for further clarification.

I. Introduction

In football the errors committed by players affects the overall result of the match. The important aspect of winning the game is the player’s performance. It can be predicted through machine learning and deep learning algorithm with the help of previous session data. The known strength and weaknesses of the player becomes helpful to improve the gameplay. The calculated performance prediction becomes vital when the process becomes automated, faster and accurate.
