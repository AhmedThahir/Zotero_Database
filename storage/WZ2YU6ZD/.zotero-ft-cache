GENERAL INFORMATION
In this annual report on Form 20-F (“Annual Report”), references to “Manchester United,” “the Company,” “our Company,” “our business,” “we,” “us” and “our” are, as the context requires, to Manchester United plc together with its consolidated subsidiaries as a consolidated entity.
Throughout this Form 20-F, we refer to the following football leagues and cups:

The term “Matchday” refers to all domestic and European football match day activities from Manchester United men’s games at Old Trafford, the Manchester United football stadium, along with receipts for domestic cup (such as the EFL Cup and the FA Cup) games not played at Old Trafford plus receipts from Manchester United women’s home games. Fees for arranging other events at the stadium are also included as Matchday revenue.
PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA
We report under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (the “IASB”), and IFRS Interpretations Committee interpretations. None of the financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
All references in this Annual Report to (i) “pounds sterling,” “pence,” “p” or “£” are to the currency of the United Kingdom, (ii) “US dollar,” “USD” or “$” are to the currency of the United States, and (iii) “Euro” or “€” are to the currency introduced at the start of the third stage of European economic and monetary union pursuant to the treaty establishing the European Community, as amended.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report contains estimates and forward-looking statements. Our estimates and forwardlooking statements are mainly based on our current expectations and estimates of future events and trends, which affect or may affect our businesses and operations. Although we believe that these estimates and forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, they are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the effects of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 (“COVID-19”) pandemic, and are made in light of information currently available to us. Many important factors, in addition to the factors described in this Annual Report, may adversely affect our results as indicated in forward-looking statements. You should read this Annual Report completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different and worse from what we expect.
All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. The words “may,” “might,” “will,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “seek,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” “contemplate,” “possible” and similar words are intended to identify estimates and forward-looking statements.
Our estimates and forward-looking statements may be influenced by various factors, including without limitation:
• risks related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the severity and duration of the outbreak, impacts from variants, actions taken by government authorities to contain the outbreak or
ii

treat its impact, the impact on our fans, sponsors and suppliers, other impacts to the business, and the Company’s ability to sufficiently manage and mitigate the strategic and operational impact of such events; • the effect of adverse economic conditions on our operations; • maintaining, enhancing and protecting our brand and reputation in order to expand our follower and sponsorship base; • our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including players; • our dependence on the performance and popularity of our men’s first team; • our ability to renew or replace key commercial agreements on similar or better terms or attract new sponsors; • the negotiation, pricing and terms of key media contracts, which are outside of our control; • our reliance on European competitions as a source of future income; • the impact of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union (the “EU”) on the movement of players or other regulations; • our dependence on relationships with certain third parties; • our relationship with merchandising, licensing, sponsor and other commercial partners; • our exposure to credit related losses in connection with key media, commercial and transfer contracts; • our dependence on Matchday revenue; • our exposure to competition, both in football and the various commercial markets in which we do business; • our ability to protect ourselves from and resolve and remediate following having experienced cyber-attacks and data breaches on our IT systems; • actions taken by other Premier League clubs that are contrary to our interests; • our relationship with the various leagues to which we belong and the application of their respective rules and regulations; • our ability to execute a digital media strategy that generates the revenue we anticipate; • the impact resulting from serious injuries or losses of the playing staff; • our ability to maintain, train and build an effective international sales and marketing infrastructure, and manage the risks associated with such an expansion; • uncertainty with regard to exchange rates, our tax rate and our cash flow; • brand impairments resulting from failures to adequately protect our intellectual property and curbing sales of counterfeit merchandise; • our ability to adequately protect against media piracy and identity theft of our followers’ account information; • our exposure to the effects of seasonality in our business; • maintaining our match attendance at Old Trafford; • any natural disasters, terrorist incidents or other events beyond our control that adversely affect our operations; • the effect of our indebtedness on our financial health and competitive position; • estimates and estimate methodologies used in preparing our consolidated financial statements; and • the future trading prices of our Class A ordinary shares and the impact of securities analysts’ reports on these prices.
iii

Other sections of this Annual Report include additional factors that could adversely impact our business and financial performance, principally “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors.” Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Therefore, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We qualify all of our forwardlooking statements by these cautionary statements. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA
This Annual Report contains industry, market, and competitive position data that are based on the industry publications and studies conducted by third parties listed below as well as our own internal estimates and research. These industry publications and third-party studies generally state that the information that they contain has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, although they do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. While we believe that each of these publications and third-party studies is reliable, we have not independently verified the market and industry data obtained from these third-party sources. While we believe our internal research is reliable and the definition of our market and industry are appropriate, neither such research nor these definitions have been verified by any independent source.
References to our “1.1 billion fans and followers” are based on the Survey commissioned by us, conducted by Kantar Media (Media Division of Kantar and division of WPP plc) (“Kantar”) in 2019, and paid for by us. As in the Survey conducted by Kantar, we defined the term “fans” as those individuals who answered survey questions, unprompted, with the answer that Manchester United was their favorite football team in the world and the term “followers” as those individuals who answered survey questions, unprompted, with the answer that Manchester United is a football team that they proactively follow in addition to their favorite football team. For example, we directed Kantar to include in the definition of “follower” a respondent who watched live Manchester United matches, followed highlights coverage or read or talked about Manchester United regularly.
The Survey was conducted during the first six months of 2019 and included over 54,000 respondents across 39 countries. It repeated a similar 2011 survey, also conducted by Kantar, to ensure comparability of approach, methodology and results. The Survey included questions on:
• demographics, age, gender and socio-economic background;
• viewership of Manchester United matches, social media following and engagement;
• relationship, awareness and attitudes to commercial partners; and
• interest in Manchester United products, including merchandise.
The Survey indicated that Manchester United has 1.1 billion combined fans and followers worldwide, comprised of 467 million fans and 635 million followers (compared to 277 million and 382 million, respectively, in 2011), including:
• a total of 731.7 million fans and followers in the Asia Pacific region (compared to 324.7 million in 2011);
• a total of 296.1 million fans and followers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (compared to 262.9 million in 2011); and
• a total of 74 million fans and followers in the Americas (compared to 71.7 million in 2011).
We expect there to be differences in the level of engagement with our brand between “followers” and “fans”, as defined in the Survey. We have not identified any practical way to measure these differences in consumer behavior and any references to our fans and followers should be viewed in that light.
iv

To calculate the number of fans and followers from the approximately 54,000 responses, Kantar applied assumptions based on third-party data sets covering certain factors including population size, country specific characteristics such as wealth and GDP per capita, and affinity for sports and media penetration. Kantar then extrapolated the results to the rest of the world, representing an extrapolated adult population of 5 billion people. However, while Kantar believes the extrapolation methodology was robust and consistent with consumer research practices, as with all surveys, there are inherent limitations in extrapolating survey results to a larger population than those actually surveyed. As a result of these limitations, our number of followers and fans may be significantly less or significantly more than the extrapolated survey results. Kantar’s extrapolated results also accounted for non-internet users. To do so, Kantar had to make assumptions about the preferences and behaviors of non-internet users in those countries surveyed. For surveyed markets with especially low internet penetration, these assumptions reduced the number of our followers in those countries and there is no guarantee that the assumptions applied are accurate. Survey results also account only for claimed consumer behavior rather than actual consumer behavior and as a result, survey results may not reflect real consumer behavior with respect to football or the consumption of our content and products. The Survey indicates that the information that it contains has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, although they do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. While we believe that the survey results are reliable, we have not independently verified the data contained in the survey.
In addition to the Survey, this Annual Report references the following industry publications and third-party studies:
• television viewership data compiled by futures sports + entertainment—Mediabrands International Limited for the 2021/22 season (the “Futures Data”); and
• a paper published by AT Kearney, Inc. in 2014 entitled “Winning in the Business of Sports” (“AT Kearney”).

(1) Revenue for the years ended 30 June 2021 and 30 June 2020 was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and governmental measures to manage the spread of the disease.
For the year ended 30 June 2022, the Old Trafford Stadium, Museum and Stadium Tour and Megastore operations were open to visitors throughout and all matches in the year operated at full capacity. This resulted in a significant increase in Matchday revenue in the year, compared to the year ended 30 June 2021 in which all but one match was played behind closed doors. Commercial revenue also increased in the year as a result of new sponsorship agreements, such as our training kit agreement with Tezos that began in February 2022, as well as the return of fans to the Manchester United Megastore. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Broadcasting revenue as a result of fewer games being played in the period with the prior year including the impact of completing the COVID-19 affected 2019/20 season, as well as increased operating expenses due to increased investment in the first team playing squad. Accordingly, this resulted in a loss for the year ended 30 June 2022 and basic and diluted loss per share.

vi

For the year ended 30 June 2021, the Old Trafford Stadium, Museum and Stadium Tour operations remained closed to visitors throughout the financial year until part way through the fourth fiscal quarter. In line with government guidelines, and with a variety of safety measures and protocols in place, including reduced fan capacity, Old Trafford Stadium welcomed back 10,000 supporters for the final home match of the season. All matches prior to this were played behind closed doors. Furthermore, the first team’s pre-season tour, scheduled for the start of fiscal 2021, had to be cancelled due to travel restrictions and the Old Trafford Megastore was closed for parts of the year due to governmentimposed restrictions. The impact of the above is a reduction in Matchday and Commercial revenues for the year ended 30 June 2021. This was partially offset by increased Broadcasting revenues due to the men’s first team’s participation in the UEFA Champions League, strong performance in both the Premier League and the UEFA Europa League, and the impact of completing the 2019/20 domestic and UEFA competitions at the start of fiscal 2021 as well as a decrease in other operating expenses due to reduced business activity as a result of COVID-19. The Group did not rely on the government furlough scheme available during the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, the above resulted in a loss for the year ended 30 June 2021 and basic and diluted loss per share.
(2) During the fourth quarter of the year ended 30 June 2021, the UK Corporation tax rate increase from 19% to 25%, effective April 2023, was substantively enacted, necessitating a remeasurement of the existing UK deferred tax liability position. This resulted in a non-cash deferred tax charge of £11.2 million in the period. Furthermore, given the current US federal corporate income tax rate of 21%, we expect future US tax liabilities to be sheltered by future foreign tax credits arising from UK tax paid. Consequently, in the year ended 30 June 2021, the US deferred tax asset was written down on the basis it was no longer expected to give rise to a future economic benefit. This resulted in a non-cash deferred tax charge of £66.6 million in the year ended 30 June 2021. Future increases in the US federal corporate income tax rate could result in a reversal of the US deferred tax asset write down.

The US federal corporate income tax rate reduced from 35% to 21% following the substantive enactment of US tax reform on 22 December 2017. This necessitated a re-measurement of the existing US deferred tax position in the period to 31 December 2017. As a result, the tax expense for the year ended 30 June 2018 included a non-cash tax accounting write off of £49.0 million. Accordingly, this resulted in a loss for the year ended 30 June 2018 and basic and diluted loss per share.
(3) For the years ended 30 June 2022, 2021, 2020 and 2018, potential ordinary shares are anti-dilutive, as their inclusion in the diluted loss per share calculation would reduce the loss per share, and hence have been excluded. For the year ended 30 June 2019, potential ordinary shares have been treated as dilutive, as their inclusion in the diluted earnings per share calculation decreases earnings per share.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as (loss)/profit for the year before depreciation and impairment, amortization, profit on disposal of intangible assets, exceptional items, net finance income/costs, and tax. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure and not a uniformly or legally defined financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is not a substitute for IFRS measures in assessing our overall financial performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with IFRS, and is to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is included in this Annual Report because it is a measure of our operating performance and we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies in industries similar to ours. We also believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to our management and investors as a measure of comparative operating performance from year to year and among companies as it is reflective of changes in pricing decisions, cost controls and other factors that affect operating performance, and it removes the effect of our asset base (primarily depreciation, impairment and amortization), material volatile items (primarily profit on disposal of our intangible assets and exceptional items), capital structure (primarily finance costs/income), and items outside the control of our management (primarily taxes).

Our management also uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and financial projections. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under IFRS as issued by the IASB.

(4) As a direct consequence of COVID-19, and the resulting government-imposed restrictions, all Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Europa League matches were suspended beginning 13 March 2020. The Premier League and FA Cup resumed in June 2020 and completed in July 2020 and August 2020 respectively. The UEFA Europa League resumed and completed in August 2020. The temporary postponement of all competitions resulted in four home and six away matches relating to 2019/20 competitions being played at the start of the 2020/21 financial year. This includes three home and three away Premier League matches, the FA Cup semi-final, one Europa League home match and the Europa League single-leg quarter-final and semi-final. From June 2020 until mid-May 2021, all matches were played behind closed doors. The final home match of the 2020/21 season and the UEFA Europa League final were played with fans in attendance at a reduced capacity.

D. RISK FACTORS
Investment in our Class A ordinary shares involves a high degree of risk. We expect to be exposed to some or all of the risks described below in our future operations. Any of the risk factors described below, as well as additional risks of which we are not currently aware, could affect our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and prospects and cause the value of our shares to decline. Moreover, if and to the extent that any of the risks described below materialize, they may occur in combination with other risks which would compound the adverse effect of such risks on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and prospects.
Risks Related to Our Business
The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
We continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, including how it will impact our commercial and Matchday operations, our sponsorship and credit agreements, and our employees, fans, sponsors, customers and suppliers. COVID-19 had a significant adverse impact on our reported results for the year ended 30 June 2021. The impact was primarily due to a reduction in commercial and Matchday revenues following the cancellation of the first team’s pre-season tour at the start of fiscal 2021 due to travel restrictions, COVID-19 related variations and all matches prior to the final home match of the season played behind closed doors in line with regulatory and organizational mandates set forth by governing bodies. Fans were welcomed back to the Old Trafford stadium at a reduced capacity of 10,000 for the final home match of the season. Further, Museum and Stadium Tour operations remained closed to visitors throughout the financial year until part way through the fourth fiscal quarter and the Old Trafford Megastore was closed for part of the year due to government- imposed restrictions. For the year ended 30 June 2022, the Old Trafford Stadium, Museum and Stadium Tour and Megastore operations were open to visitors throughout and all matches in the year operated at full capacity. However, there can be no certainty that the currently lifted UK government-imposed restrictions and present full capacity at Old Trafford stadium will continue. The nature of the pandemic, including as a result of variants, may result in government restrictions being re-imposed in the future or reduced fan attendance based on individuals’ risk tolerance. The extent to which our operations may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend largely on future developments including, without limitation, continuation of matches played in front of a crowd and at full capacity, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. The continued impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, including from variants, and actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact may further impact our operations. As such, we are unable to predict with certainty the ultimate further impact that COVID-19 may have on our business, future results of
1

operations, financial position or cash flows. We are also unable to predict with certainty the impact that COVID-19 may continue to have on our fans, sponsors, customers, and suppliers; however, any material effect on these parties could negatively impact us. In addition, if there is a future resurgence of COVID-19, the negative impacts on our business may be exacerbated. If we are unable to sufficiently manage and mitigate the strategic and operational impact of COVID-19, in the short- and medium-term, the future results of our business may be materially negatively impacted. Though we continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic closely, this situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently. Moreover, to the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic harms our business and operations, many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section should be interpreted as heightened risks.
If we are unable to maintain and enhance our brand and reputation, particularly in new markets, or if events occur that damage our brand and reputation, our ability to expand our follower base, sponsors, and commercial partners or to sell significant quantities of our products may be impaired.
The success of our business depends on the value and strength of our brand and reputation. Our brand and reputation are also integral to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our follower base, sponsors and commercial partners. To be successful in the future we believe we must preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brand across all of our revenue streams. For instance, we have in the past experienced, and we expect that in the future we will continue to receive, a high degree of media coverage. Unfavorable publicity regarding our men’s first team’s performance in league and cup competitions or their behavior off the field, our ability to attract and retain certain players and coaching staff or actions by or changes in our ownership, could negatively affect our brand and reputation. Failure to respond effectively to negative publicity could also further erode our brand and reputation. In addition, events in the football industry, even if unrelated to us, may negatively affect our brand or reputation. As a result, the size, engagement and loyalty of our follower base and the demand for our products may decline. Damage to our brand or reputation or loss of our followers’ commitment for any of these reasons could impair our ability to expand our follower base, sponsors and commercial partners or our ability to sell significant quantities of our products, which would result in decreased revenue across our revenue streams and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our brand and reputation.
In addition, maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation may require us to make substantial investments. We cannot assure you that such investments will be successful. Failure to successfully maintain and enhance the Manchester United brand or our reputation or excessive or unsuccessful expenses in connection with this effort could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
Our business is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including players.
We are highly dependent on members of our management, coaching staff and our players. Competition for talented players and staff is, and will continue to be, intense. Our ability to attract and retain the highest quality players for our men’s first team and youth academy, as well as coaching staff, is critical to our men’s first team’s success in league and cup competitions, increasing popularity and, consequently, critical to our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Our success and many achievements over the last twenty years does not necessarily mean that we will continue to be successful in the future, whether as a result of changes in player personnel, coaching staff or otherwise. A downturn in the performance of our men’s first team could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain coaches and players. Further, in 2020, the United Kingdom formally left the EU and as a result we are no longer able to rely on European regulations relating to the movement of players between the United Kingdom and the European Economic Area (“EEA”). See “—The departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union may adversely affect our operations and financial results.” In addition, our popularity in certain countries or regions may depend, at least in part, on fielding certain players from those countries or regions. While we enter into employment contracts with each of our key personnel with the aim of securing their services for the term of the contract, the retention of their services for the full term of the contract cannot be guaranteed due to possible contract disputes or approaches by other clubs. Our failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a negative impact on our ability to effectively manage and grow our business.

We are dependent upon the performance and popularity of our men’s first team.
Our revenue streams are driven by the performance and popularity of our men’s first team. Significant sources of our revenue are the result of historically strong performances in English domestic and European competitions, specifically the Premier League, the FA Cup, the EFL Cup, the Champions League and the Europa League. Our revenue varies significantly depending on our men’s first team’s participation and performance in these competitions. Our men’s first team’s performance can affect all four of our revenue streams:
• sponsorship revenue through sponsorship relationships;
• retail, merchandising, apparel & product licensing revenue through product sales;
• Broadcasting revenue through the frequency of appearances, performance based share of league broadcasting revenue, Champions League/Europa League/Europa Conference League distributions and MUTV distribution through linear and digital platforms; and
• Matchday revenue through ticket sales.
Our men’s first team currently plays in the Premier League, the top football league in England. Our performance in the Premier League directly affects, and a weak performance in the Premier League could adversely affect, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. For example, our revenue from the sale of products, media rights, tickets and hospitality would fall considerably if our men’s first team were relegated from, or otherwise ceased to play in, the Premier League, the Champions League, the Europa League or the Europa Conference league.
We cannot ensure that our men’s first team will be successful in the Premier League or in the other leagues and tournaments in which it plays. Relegation from the Premier League or a general decline in the success of our men’s first team, particularly in consecutive seasons, would negatively affect our ability to attract or retain talented players and coaching staff, as well as supporters, sponsors and other commercial partners, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
It may not be possible to renew or replace key commercial agreements on similar or better terms, or attract new sponsors.
Our Commercial revenue for each of the years ended 30 June 2022, 2021 and 2020 represented 44.2%, 47.0% and 54.8% of our total revenue, respectively. The substantial majority of our Commercial revenue is generated from commercial agreements with our sponsors, and these agreements have finite terms. When these contracts expire, we may not be able to renew or replace them with contracts on similar or better terms or at all. Our most important commercial contracts include contracts with global, regional and supplier sponsors representing industries including sportswear, remote connectivity software, blockchain, spirits, automotive, hotels, betting and kitchen and bathroom fixtures and generators, which typically have contract terms of two to five years.
If we fail to renew or replace these key commercial agreements on similar or better terms, we could experience a material reduction in our Commercial revenue. Such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on our overall revenue and our ability to continue to compete with the top football clubs in England and Europe.
As part of our business plan, we intend to continue to grow our commercial portfolio by developing and expanding our product categorized approach, which will include partnering with additional sponsors. We may not be able to successfully execute our business plan in promoting our brand to attract new sponsors. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in implementing our business plan or that our Commercial revenue will continue to grow at the same rate as it has in the past or at all. Any of these events could negatively affect our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
The underlying probability of being unable to renew or replace key contracts on similar or more favorable terms, or to partner with additional sponsors, has increased as the impact of COVID-19 and
3

other economic pressures are felt across the global economy. As a result, there may be a shift in focus for the majority of companies in the short- to medium-term, as these companies reduce perceived “excess” spend on marketing in favor of protecting the operational and financial stability of the entity. See “—The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.”
Negotiation, pricing and terms of key media contracts are outside of our control and those contracts may change in the future.
For each of the years ended 30 June 2022, 2021 and 2020, 65.3%, 67.5% and 80.3% of our Broadcasting revenue, respectively, was generated from the media rights for Premier League matches, and 31.4% 29.0% and 12.0% of our Broadcasting revenue, respectively, was generated from the media rights for UEFA matches. Contracts for these media rights and certain other revenue for those competitions (both domestically and internationally) are negotiated collectively by the Premier League and the Union of European Football Associations (“UEFA”) respectively. We are not a party to the contracts negotiated by the Premier League and UEFA. Further, we do not participate in and therefore do not have any direct influence on the outcome of contract negotiations. As a result, we may be subject to media rights contracts with media distributors with whom we may not otherwise contract or media rights contracts that are not as favorable to us as we might otherwise be able to negotiate individually with media distributors. Furthermore, the limited number of media distributors bidding for Premier League and UEFA club competition media rights may result in reduced prices paid for those rights and, as a result, a decline in revenue received from media contracts.
In addition, although an agreement has been reached for the sale of Premier League broadcasting rights through the end of the 2024/25 football season and for the sale of UEFA club competition broadcasting rights through the end of the 2023/24 football season, future agreements may not maintain our current level of Broadcasting revenue. Furthermore, existing broadcasting agreements have been and may continue to be, and future broadcasting agreements may also be, adversely impacted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See “—The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.”
Future intervention by the European Commission (“EC”), the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”), UK authorities, or other competent authorities and courts having jurisdiction may also have a negative effect on our revenue from media rights in the EEA. Enforcement of competition laws and changes to copyright regimes may require changes to sales models that could negatively affect the amount which copyright holders, such as the Premier League, are able to derive from the exploitation of rights within the EU. As a result, our Broadcasting revenue from the sale of those rights could decrease.
It is likely that there will be future regulatory intervention by the EC relating to the grant of exclusive licenses of content on a territorial basis within the EEA insofar as they prohibit or limit the cross-border provision by satellite or internet transmission of retail pay-TV services in response to unsolicited demand (so-called “passive sales”). In the cases of the Premier League & others vs. QC Leisure & Others / Karen Murphy vs. Media Protection Services, the CJEU ruled that EU free movement rules prevented enforcement of national laws to prevent importation and sale of decoding devices marketed in other Member States. It is an open question whether this finding is confined to broadcasting by satellite. The CJEU held further that EU competition rules prohibit any agreement designed to guarantee absolute territorial exclusivity by restricting passive sales within the EU (i.e. by obliging broadcasters not to meet unsolicited demand for decoding devices enabling access to the right holder’s protected subject-matter with a view to their use outside the territory covered by the license agreement).
Subsequently, in January 2014 the EC launched a competition investigation into exclusive licensing arrangements between US Studios and various platforms in Europe (the major platform in each of the five largest Member States). In July 2015, the EC issued a Statement of Objections in Case COMP/40023—Crossborder access to pay-TV setting out its preliminary view that certain provisions in the license agreements between the studios and Sky UK would eliminate cross-border competition and constitute a violation of EU competition rules. According to the EC, these provisions require Sky UK to block or limit access to films through geo-blocking its online services or through its satellite pay-TV services to consumers outside of the United Kingdom and Ireland (and thus prevent Sky UK from responding to passive sales requests). The EC was carrying out parallel investigations into cross-border access to pay-TV services in France, Italy,
4

Germany and Spain. Studios and platforms argue that EU law does not preclude enforcement of their copyright and that the restrictions are necessary to ensure adequate financing of content creation because content value varies considerably across Member States.
On 22 April 2016, the EC announced that Paramount, while not agreeing with the concerns expressed in the Statement of Objections, had offered to settle the case by offering a series of commitments, including an undertaking not to enter into pay-TV agreements that prohibit their licensees from responding to passive sales requests. The commitments cover both linear pay-TV services and (when covered by the broadcaster’s licenses) subscription video-on-demand services. The EC accepted these commitments on 27 July 2016. On 8 December 2016, the French TV broadcaster Groupe Canal + brought an action seeking annulment of the EC’s decision to accept the commitments. On 12 December 2018, the EU General Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the EC decision as lawful in identifying competition concerns and finding the commitments suitable to resolve them. Shortly before and on the same and following day of the General Court’s judgment, Disney, NBC Universal, Sony Pictures, Warner Bros. and Sky also offered commitments, which the EC accepted on 7 March 2019 and closed the investigation. The commitments foresee that the restrictive clauses will not be applied nor re-introduced in the film licensing contracts, without prejudice to the studios’ rights under copyright law or the Portability Regulation. On 15 February 2019, Canal + appealed the General Court’s judgment before the CJEU and on 19 June 2019, it also appealed before the General Court the EC decision accepting the commitments by Sky and four Hollywood studios.
On 20 December 2020, the CJEU overturned the General Court’s judgment of 12 December 2018; the CJEU found that the General Court had erred in law in its assessment of the proportionality of the adverse effects on the interests of third parties, such as Canal +, resulting from the EC acceptance of the commitments offered by Paramount. In particular, the CJEU considered that the General Court could not refer such contracting partners to the national courts in order to have their contractual rights enforced; national courts could not decide contrary to an EC decision by declaring the relevant clauses compatible or requiring an operator to breach its commitments which have been made binding by that decision. Instead, the CJEU found that when assessing commitments proposed the EC must also assess the proportionality of adverse effects of the commitments on the interests of third parties so that those third parties’ rights are not rendered meaningless—which was the case for the contractual rights of Canal + vis-à-vis Paramount. Consequently, the CJEU set aside the General Court’s judgment and gave final judgment in the matter by annulling the EC decision accepting Paramount’s commitments. On 31 March 2021 the EC withdraw its decision of 7 March 2019 accepting the commitments by Sky and four Hollywood studios and closed the proceedings in the case, since the scope of commitments was essentially identical to the annulled commitments by Paramount; and the pending appeal by Canal + against the now withdrawn decision was closed without need for adjudication by the General Court on 6 May 2021. While these investigations had targeted film content, any future decision could be applicable to any pay-TV content, including sport.
In addition to this regulatory action, the EU as part of its Digital Single Market (“DSM”) strategy adopted on 8 June 2017 the Portability Regulation, which is designed to enable consumers to access their content services while travelling across Europe. The Portability Regulation became applicable on 20 March 2018. The EU has also adopted a regulation on unjustified geo-blocking, which became applicable on 3 December 2018. Copyright protected content is excluded but the EC must review and report on the exclusion. On 30 November 2020, the EC published this report. The report identified potential benefits of extending the scope of the regulation to cover audio-visual content, depending on copyright-licensing practices and on copyright-law considerations. However, it also identified the challenges and potential impact of such an extension on the overall dynamics of the audio-visual sector. Therefore, the EC would launch a stakeholder dialogue with the sector to discuss concrete ways of improve consumers’ access to audiovisual content across the EU, before considering any follow-up measures. A further stock-taking exercise should be planned for 2022, the outcome of which will determine any EC proposal for any legislative amendments or follow-up actions. This may lead to proposals for inclusion of content protected by copyright and neighbouring rights.
As part of the DSM initiative, the EC has also sought to modernize EU copyright rules to allow for wider access to online content across the EU, including by extending rights clearance mechanisms in the Satellite and Cable Directive. The EC published its proposal for a Regulation on Online Transmissions on 14 September 2016, which in particular contains the proposal that the country of origin principle be extended
5

to online broadcast services. In practice, this would mean that licenses for simulcast and catch-up rights, for example, for the United Kingdom would be construed as covering the entire EEA (as long as the United Kingdom remains subject to EU law). The European Parliament and the Council subsequently turned the draft Regulation on Online Transmissions into a Directive, including substantial amendments limiting the country of origin principle. As a result, the country of origin principle will apply to radio broadcasts, but not to television broadcasts of sports events. In parallel, the revised Copyright Directive has inter alia strengthened the position of rights owners by making online platforms responsible for taking certain actions against user-uploaded content which violates copyright. Both Directives were adopted in April 2019. The deadline for implementation of both Directives was 7 June 2021. As at 19 May 2022, a number of Member States have still not implemented the Directives into national law including (in relation to the Online Transmissions Directive) Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland, and (in relation to the Copyright Directive), Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Greece, France, Latvia, Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland and Sweden). All other Member States have implemented both Directives into national law.
In addition, also as part of the DSM initiative, the European Parliament and the Council adopted on 6 November 2018, a revision of the Audiovisual Media Services. The deadline for transposition into national law was 19 September 2020. As at 3 August 2022, all member states other than the Czech Republic, Ireland, Slovakia had notified the EC of its implementation into law. This Directive applies to traditional TV broadcasters, with the revision inter alia extending the scope for some provisions to also cover videosharing platforms. The revision has not affected Article 14 on the possibility of national measures ensuring the non-exclusive broadcast of events of major importance for society.
Finally, as part the DSM initiative and following stakeholder consultations, on 15 December 2020, the EC proposed two legislative initiatives to upgrade rules governing digital services in the EU: the Digital Services Act (“DSA”) and the Digital Markets Act (“DMA”). The DSA seeks to update the rules concerning e-commerce, for instance, by providing for enforceable obligations and increased accountability rules for all digital services that connect consumers to goods, services, or content, in relation to, for example, users’ safety and trust, harmful/illegal online content, content moderation and removal, and advertisement targeting. These rules would be enforced by designated national competent authorities. The DMA, which would be enforced by the EC, seeks to address market imbalances associated with large online platforms acting as gatekeepers, defined under certain criteria. To this end, the DMA foresees obligations on their daily operations, for example, by enabling transparency for advertisers, ensuring interoperability with competing third-party software in certain cases, and prohibiting gatekeepers to block users from un-installing software or apps. In contrast, the EC will not pursue separately the possible introduction of a broader ex ante new competition tool addressing structural competition problems in a timely and effective manner. The EU reached political agreement on the DMA in March 2022 and the DSA in April 2022. The European Parliament and Council of Ministers each approved the DMA in July 2022. The European Parliament approved the DSA in July 2022, and approval by the Council of Ministers is likely to follow in September 2022. Both Acts will come into force 20 days after publication in the Official Journal. The DSA will be directly applicable across the EU on 1 January 2024, or 15 months after coming into force if later. The DMA will be directly applicable 6 months after coming into force.
European competitions cannot be relied upon as a source of income.
Qualification for the Champions League is largely dependent upon our men’s first team’s performance in the Premier League and, in some circumstances, the Champions League or Europa League in the previous season. Qualification for the Champions League cannot, therefore, be guaranteed. Failure to qualify for the Champions League would result in a material reduction in revenue for each season in which our men’s first team did not participate. To help mitigate this impact the majority of playing contracts for our men’s first team include step-ups in remuneration which are contingent on participation in the group stage of the Champions League. Inclusive of Broadcasting revenue, prize money and Matchday revenue, our combined Broadcasting and Matchday revenue related to European competitions was £75.0 million, £73.8 million and £20.9 million for each of the years ended 30 June 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As a result of our men’s first team performance during the 2021/22 season, our men’s first team will participate in the 2022/23 Europa League rather than the Champions League.

In addition, our participation in the Champions League, Europa League or Europa Conference League may be influenced by other factors beyond our control. For example, the number of places in each European competition available to the clubs of each national football association in Europe can vary from year to year based on a ranking system. If the performance of English clubs in Europe declines, the number of places in each European competition available to English clubs may decline and it may be more difficult for our men’s first team to qualify for European competition in future seasons. Further, the rules governing qualification for European competitions (whether at the European or national level) may change and make it more difficult for our men’s first team to qualify for European competition in future seasons.
We are a founder member of the European Club Association (“ECA”), an independent organization set up to work with football governing bodies to protect and promote the interests of football clubs at the European level.
UEFA implemented changes to the format of the Champions League and Europa League, which took effect from 2018/19. The key changes related to the access list for both competitions and the methodology for financial distributions. With respect to the Champions League, the top four clubs from the four topranked UEFA national associations (of which England is currently one) qualify automatically for the group stage of the Champions League. With respect to the financial distribution methodology, in addition to the previous three-pillar system (starting fee, performance fees and market pool), UEFA introduced a fourth pillar being the individual club coefficient. The individual club coefficient is determined by reference to past performance in UEFA club competitions over a ten-year period with additional points for historical winners of UEFA club competitions.
In May 2022, UEFA announced a new format for the Champions League which will begin in the 2024/25 season. This format sees the number of participating teams increased from 32 to 36 with the number of Group Stage matches increasing from 6 to 8. The new format provides scope for one more place for an English club in the competition dependent on the collective performance of clubs from that nation in the previous season. Two places in the competition will be allocated in this manner, one to each nation that performed best collectively in the preceding season. In addition, UEFA Club Competitions SA (“UCC SA”) was established by UEFA to advise and make recommendations to UEFA on strategic business matters and opportunities concerning club competitions. Half of the administration board is appointed by UEFA and the other half by the ECA.
In December 2018, UEFA approved the introduction of a third UEFA club competition to run alongside both the Champions League and Europa League. The competition, known as the UEFA Europa Conference League (“Europa Conference League”), commenced in 2021/22. The competition does not have an impact on the Champions League but does reduce the number of teams competing in the Europa League from 48 teams to 32. This results in three competitions being held with 32 teams competing in each, compared to the previous structure of 32 teams in the Champions League and 48 teams in the Europa League. The winner of the new competition will be entitled to enter the following season’s UEFA Europa League group stage. England’s overall access quota remains unchanged, but the quota now applies across the three UEFA competitions. The top four clubs from the four top-ranked UEFA national associations still automatically qualify for the Champions League group stage. The team finishing in fifth position in the Premier League and the FA Cup winners will qualify for the Europa League group stage, unless the FA Cup winners finish in positions one to five in the Premier League, in which case the team finishing in sixth position will also qualify for the Europa League group stage. The EFL Cup winners will qualify for the Europa Conference League play-offs unless they have already qualified for the Champions League or Europa League, in which case the team finishing in sixth position (or seventh position if the sixth has already qualified for the Champions League or Europa League) will take their place. Financial distribution methods for the Champions League and the Europa League remain unchanged.
Moreover, because of the prestige associated with participating in the European competitions, particularly the Champions League, failure to qualify for any European competition, particularly for consecutive seasons, could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain talented players and coaching staff, as well as supporters, sponsors and other commercial partners. Failure to participate in the Champions League for two or more consecutive seasons would also reduce annual payments under the agreement with
7

adidas by 30% of the applicable payment for the year in which the second or other consecutive season of nonparticipation falls. Any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and cash flow.
Our business depends in part on relationships with certain third parties.
We consider the development of our commercial assets to be central to our ongoing business plan and a driver of future growth. For example, our current contract with adidas that began with the 2015/16 season provides them with certain global technical sponsorship and dual-branded licensing rights. While we expect to be able to continue to execute our business plan in the future with the support of adidas, we remain subject to these contractual provisions and our business plan could be negatively impacted by non-compliance or poor execution of our strategy by adidas. Further, any interruption in our ability to obtain the services of adidas or other third parties or deterioration in their performance could negatively impact this portion of our operations. Furthermore, if our arrangement with adidas is terminated or modified against our interest, we may not be able to find alternative solutions for this portion of our business on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us or at all.
In the future, we may enter into additional arrangements permitting third parties to use our brand and trademarks. The steps we take to carefully select our partners may not lead to successful arrangements. Our partners may fail to fulfill their obligations under their agreements or have interests that differ from or conflict with our own. For example, we are dependent on our sponsors and commercial partners to effectively implement quality controls over products using our brand and/or trademarks. The inability of such sponsors and commercial partners to meet our quality standards, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other economic pressures, could negatively affect consumer confidence in the quality and value of our brand, which could result in lower product sales. Any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and cash flow.
We are exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to Premier League and UEFA media contracts as well as our key commercial and transfer contracts.
We derive the substantial majority of our Broadcasting revenue from media contracts negotiated by the Premier League and UEFA with media distributors, and although the Premier League obtains guarantees to support certain of its media contracts, typically in the form of letters of credit issued by commercial banks, it remains our single largest credit exposure. We derive our Commercial and sponsorship revenue from certain corporate sponsors, including global, regional and supplier sponsors (which includes new businesses operating in emerging markets) in respect of which we may manage our credit risk by seeking advance payments, installments and/or bank guarantees where appropriate. The substantial majority of this revenue is derived from a limited number of sources. We are also exposed to other football clubs globally for the payment of transfer fees on players. Depending on the transaction, some of these fees are paid to us in installments. We try to manage our credit risk with respect to those clubs by requiring payments in advance or, in the case of payments on installment, requiring bank guarantees on such payments in certain circumstances. However, we cannot ensure these efforts will eliminate our credit exposure to other clubs. A change in credit quality at one of the media broadcasters for the Premier League or UEFA, one of our sponsors or a club to whom we have sold a player can increase the risk that such counterparty is unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us. The failure of a major television broadcaster for the Premier League or UEFA club competitions to pay outstanding amounts owed to its respective league or the failure of one of our key sponsors or a club to pay outstanding amounts owed to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
The residual counterparty credit risk from our commercial partnerships or the failure of any significant customer or another club, and non-fulfillment of contractual obligations, has increased as a result of certain global and regional partners requesting payment deferrals while dealing with the fallout of COVID-19. This has the potential to significantly impact club operations if a major commercial partner were to defer or default on payments. See “—The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.”

Matchday revenue from our supporters is a significant portion of overall revenue.
A significant amount of our revenue derives from ticket sales and other Matchday revenue for our men’s first team matches at Old Trafford and our share of gate receipts from domestic cup matches. In particular, the revenue generated from ticket sales and other Matchday revenue at Old Trafford will be highly dependent on the continued attendance at matches of our individual and corporate supporters as well as the number of home matches we play each season. During each of the 2021/22, 2020/21 and 2019/20 seasons, we played 26, 34 and 24 home matches respectively and our Matchday revenue was £110.5 million, £7.1 million and £89.8 million for the years ended 30 June 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Matchday revenue for the years ended 30 June 2021 and 30 June 2020 was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended 30 June 2021, 33 of our 34 home matches were played behind closed doors. Fans were in attendance for the final home match of the season at a reduced capacity in line with government guidelines. For the year ended 30 June 2020, government-imposed restrictions from mid-March 2020 resulted in the deferral of a number of matches to the 2020/21 financial year, as well as all remaining matches being played behind closed doors. We returned to full capacity for the entirety of the 2021/22 season. Match attendance is influenced by a number of factors, some of which are partly or wholly outside of our control. These factors include the success of our men’s first team, broadcasting coverage and general economic conditions in the United Kingdom, which affect personal disposable income and corporate marketing and hospitality budgets. A reduction in Matchday attendance, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related regulations to contain it, could continue to have a material adverse effect on our Matchday revenue and our overall business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. See “—The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.”
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, both within Europe and internationally, and increased competition could cause our profitability to decline.
We face competition from other football clubs in England and Europe. In the Premier League, investment from wealthy team owners has led to teams with deep financial backing that are able to acquire top players and coaching staff, which could result in improved performance from those teams in domestic and European competitions. As the Premier League continues to grow in popularity, the interest of wealthy potential owners may increase, leading to additional clubs substantially improving their financial position. Competition from European clubs also remains strong. Despite the adoption of the UEFA financial fair play initiative, a set of financial monitoring rules on clubs participating in the Champions League and Europa League, and the Premier League Profitability and Sustainability Rules, a similar set of rules monitoring Premier League clubs, European and Premier League football clubs are spending substantial sums on transfer fees and player salaries. Competition from inside and outside the Premier League has led to higher salaries for our players as well as increased competition on the field. The increase in competition could result in our men’s first team finishing lower in the Premier League than we have in the past and jeopardizing our qualification for or results in European competitions. Competition within England could also cause our men’s first team to fail to advance in the FA Cup and EFL Cup.
In addition, from a commercial perspective, we actively compete across many different industries and within many different markets. We believe our primary sources of competition, both in Europe and internationally, include, but are not limited to:
• other businesses seeking corporate sponsorships and commercial partners such as sports teams, other entertainment events and television and digital media outlets;
• providers of sports apparel and equipment seeking retail, merchandising, apparel & product licensing opportunities;
• digital content providers seeking consumer attention and leisure time, advertiser income and consumer e-commerce activity;
• other types of television programming seeking access to broadcasters and advertiser income; and
• alternative forms of corporate hospitality and live entertainment for the sale of Matchday tickets such as other live sports events, concerts, festivals, theater and similar events.
9

All of the above forms of competition could have a material adverse effect on any of our four revenue streams and our overall business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
A cyber-attack on, or disruption to, our IT systems or other systems utilized in our operations could compromise our operations, adversely impact our reputation and subject us to liability.
As a high-profile brand we are susceptible to the risk of a cyber-attack on our IT systems or other third-party systems utilized in our operations. We experience cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time. For example, we experienced such an attack in or about November 2020, which resulted in certain non-consumer data being compromised and the disruption of our enterprise systems and applications, prior to restoration of secure computing operations. In response to the attack, we have implemented further controls and planned for and taken other preventative actions to further strengthen our systems against future attacks. However, we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security, that we will be able to react in a timely manner, or that our remediation efforts following any past or future attacks will be successful. A cyber-attack could disable the information technology systems we use or depend on to operate our business and give rise to the loss of significant amounts of personal data or other sensitive information, potentially subjecting us to criminal or civil sanctions or other liability. See “—We are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection, data security and safeguarding. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.” Similarly, any disruption to or failures in our IT systems or other third-party systems utilized in our operations could have an adverse impact on our ability to operate our business and lead to reputational damage. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Furthermore, as attempted attacks continue to evolve in scope and sophistication, we may incur significant costs in modifying or enhancing our IT security systems and processes in an attempt to defend against such attacks. There can be no assurance, however, that any security systems or processes we, or third party providers on which we rely, currently have in place or that may be implemented in the future will be successful in preventing or mitigating the harm from such attacks.
We are subject to special rules and regulations regarding insolvency and bankruptcy.
We are subject to, among other things, special insolvency or bankruptcy-related rules of the Premier League and the Football Association (the “FA”). Those rules empower the Premier League board to direct certain payments otherwise due to us to the FA and its members, associate members and affiliates, certain other English football leagues and certain other entities if it is reasonably satisfied that we have failed to pay certain creditors including other football clubs, the Premier League and the Football League.
If we experience financial difficulty, we could also face sanctions under the Premier League rules, including suspension from the Premier League, European competitions, the FA Cup and certain other competitions, the deduction of league points from us in the Premier League or Football League and loss of control of player registrations. For example, the Premier League could prevent us from playing, thereby cutting off our income from ticket sales and putting many of our other sources of revenue at risk. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition, or cash flow, as well as our ability to meet our financial obligations.
Premier League voting rules may allow other clubs to take action contrary to our interests.
The Premier League is governed by its 20 club shareholders with most rule changes requiring the support of a minimum of 14 of the clubs. This allows a minority of clubs to block changes they view as unfavorable to their interests. In addition, it allows a concerted majority of the clubs to pass rules that may be disadvantageous to the remaining six clubs. Our interests may not always align with the majority of clubs and it may be difficult for us to effect changes that are advantageous to us. At the same time, it is possible that other clubs may take action that we view as contrary to our interests. If the Premier League clubs pass rules that limit our ability to operate our business as we have planned or otherwise affect the payments made to us, we may be unable to achieve our goals and strategies or increase our revenue.
10

Our digital media strategy may not generate the revenue we anticipate.
We maintain contact with, and provide entertainment to, our global follower base through a number of digital and other media channels, including the internet, mobile services and applications, and social media. While we have attracted a significant number of followers to our digital media assets, including our website and mobile application, the associated future revenue and income potential is uncertain. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the challenges, risks and difficulties we may encounter in this new and rapidly evolving market, including:
• our ability to retain our current global follower base, build our follower base and increase engagement with our followers through our digital media assets, particularly those on third-party digital media platforms;
• our ability to enhance the content offered through our digital media assets and increase our subscriber base;
• our ability to effectively generate revenue from interaction with our followers through our digital media assets;
• our ability to attract new sponsors and advertisers, retain existing sponsors and advertisers and demonstrate that our digital media assets will deliver value to them;
• our ability to develop our digital media assets in a cost-effective manner and operate our digital media services profitably and securely;
• our ability to identify and capitalize on new digital media business opportunities; and
• our ability to compete with other sports and other media for users’ time.
In addition, as we expand our digital and other media channels, including mobile services, applications, and social media, revenue from our other business sectors may decrease, including our Broadcasting revenue. As a consequence of our utilization of third-party media platforms, particularly social media, we are subject to third-party algorithms which we do not have control over. A change to these algorithms or the business strategy and operating models of these platforms may have a knock-on impact on our business. Moreover, the increase in subscriber base in some of these digital and other media channels may limit the growth of the subscriber base and popularity of other channels. Further, governmental or other regulatory actions against social media platforms could result in a loss of some or all of our social media followers on such platform. Failure to successfully address these risks and difficulties could affect our overall business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.
Serious injuries to or losses of playing staff may affect our performance, and therefore our results of operations and financial condition.
Injuries to members of the playing staff, particularly if career-threatening or career-ending, could have a detrimental effect on our business. Such injuries could have a negative effect upon our men’s first team’s performance and may also result in a loss of the income that would otherwise have resulted from a transfer of that player’s registration. In addition, depending on the circumstances, we may write down the carrying value of a player on our balance sheet and record an impairment charge in our operating expenses to reflect any losses resulting from career-threatening or career-ending injuries to that player. Our strategy is to maintain a squad of men’s first team players sufficient to mitigate the risk of player injuries. However, this strategy may not be sufficient to mitigate all financial losses in the event of an injury, and as a result such injury may affect the performance of our men’s first team, and therefore our business, results of operations financial condition and cash flow.
Inability to renew our insurance policies could expose us to significant losses.
We insure against the accidental death (including death by natural causes) or permanent disablement (resulting in an inability to continue their playing career with Manchester United and/or any other club in one of the top five European leagues) of certain members of our men’s first team, although typically not at such player’s full market value. Such insurance also excludes incidents which occur while playing matches or training. We also have catastrophe coverage in the event of an incident (such as travel or terrorist related
11

incidents) that results in the accidental death or permanent disablement of multiple members of our men’s first team playing squad. We also carry non-player related insurance typical for our business (including combined liability, property damage, business interruption, terrorism and directors and officers insurance). When any of our insurance policies expire, it may not be possible to renew them on the same terms, or at all. In such circumstances, some of our business activities and/or assets may be uninsured. If any of these uninsured business activities or assets were to suffer damage, we could suffer a financial loss. Our most valuable tangible asset is the Old Trafford stadium. An inability to renew insurance policies covering our players, Old Trafford, the Carrington training ground (“Carrington”) or other valuable assets could expose us to significant losses.
In addition to the above, for the period ending 31 December 2022, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (“FIFA”) has confirmed that it will provide insurance coverage for loss of wages (temporary disablement), subject to a maximum period of 365 days (excluding the first 28 days) and a cap of €7.5 million per claim per player, paid by the club to our players subsequent to an injury incurred while playing for their senior national team in a match played under the FIFA international match calendar. This includes any claims arising from the 2022 World Cup and the 2022 Women’s European Championship, both of which occur in the current policy period. Neither FIFA nor national football associations are obliged to provide accidental death or permanent disablement insurance coverage for players while on international duty. These terms are subject to review when the policy is due for renewal.
Our international expansion and operations in foreign markets expose us to risks associated with international sales and operations.
We intend to continue to expand internationally and operate in select foreign markets. Managing a global organization is difficult, time consuming and expensive. Our inexperience in operating the club’s businesses globally increases the risk that any future international expansion efforts that we may undertake will not be successful. In addition, conducting international operations subjects us to risks such as the lack of familiarity with and unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements; difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; potentially adverse tax consequences, including foreign value added tax systems, and restrictions on repatriation of earnings; the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and legal standards; increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; the lack of strong intellectual property regimes and political, social and economic instability abroad. Operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. The investment and additional resources required to establish operations and manage growth in other countries may not produce desired levels of revenue or profitability.
In many foreign countries, particularly in certain developing economies, it is not uncommon to encounter business practices that are prohibited by certain regulations, such as the UK Bribery Act 2010, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws. Our and our subsidiaries’ efforts undertaken to comply with respect to these laws may not prevent our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations from taking actions in violation of such policies and procedures. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our or our subsidiaries’ policies and procedures or the law, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and the price of our Class A ordinary shares.
Fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.
Our functional and reporting currency is pounds sterling and substantially all of our costs are denominated in pounds sterling. However, Broadcasting revenue from our participation in UEFA club competitions, as well as certain other revenue, is generated in Euros. We also occasionally enter into transfer agreements, commercial partner agreements and other contracts which are payable in Euros. In addition, we have US dollar foreign exchange exposure relating to our secured term loan facility and senior secured notes as well as Commercial revenue from certain sponsors. We hedge the foreign exchange risk on our future US dollar revenues using a portion of our US dollar denominated secured term loan facility and senior secured notes as the hedging instrument. We incurred foreign exchange losses in our statement of profit or loss on our unhedged US dollar denominated secured term loan facility and senior secured notes of £58.7 million in the year ended 30 June 2022, as well as £4.4 million in the year ended 30 June 2020. In the
12

year ended 30 June 2021, we recorded a gain of £48.0 million. For the years ended 30 June 2022, 2021 and 2020 approximately 11.6%, 15.0% and 3.3% of our total revenue was generated in Euros, respectively, and approximately 13.7%, 9.0% and 22.9% of our total revenue was generated in US dollars, respectively. We may also enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of this transactional exposure. We offset the value of our non-sterling revenue and the value of the corresponding hedge before including such amounts in our overall revenue. Our results of operations have in the past and will in the future fluctuate due to movements in exchange rates and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in further volatility.
Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure our brand.
Like other popular brands, we are susceptible to instances of brand infringement (such as counterfeiting and other unauthorized uses of our intellectual property rights). We seek to protect our brand assets by ensuring that we own and control certain intellectual property rights in and to those assets and, where appropriate, by enforcing those intellectual property rights. For example, we own the copyright in our logo, and our logo and trade name are registered as trademarks (or are the subject of applications for registration) in a number of jurisdictions in Europe, Asia Pacific, Africa, North America and South America. However, it is not possible to detect all instances of brand infringement. Additionally, where instances of brand infringement are detected, we cannot guarantee that such instances will be prevented as there may be legal or factual circumstances which give rise to uncertainty as to the validity, scope and enforceability of our intellectual property rights in the brand assets. Furthermore, the laws of certain countries in which we license our brand and conduct operations, particularly those in Asia may not offer the same level of protection to intellectual property rights holders as those in the United Kingdom, the rest of Europe and the United States, or the time required to enforce our intellectual property rights under these legal regimes may be lengthy and delay recovery. For example, the unauthorized use of intellectual property is common and widespread in Asia and enforcement of intellectual property rights by local regulatory agencies is inconsistent. If we were to fail or be unable to secure, protect, maintain and/or enforce the intellectual property rights which vest in our brand assets, then we could lose our exclusive right to exploit such brand assets. Infringement of our trademark, copyright and other intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business. We also license our intellectual property rights to third parties. In an effort to protect our brand, we enter into licensing agreements with these third parties which govern the use of our intellectual property and which require our licensees to abide by quality control standards with respect to such use. We cannot assure you that our efforts to police our licensees’ use of our intellectual property will be sufficient to ensure their compliance. The failure of our licensees to comply with the terms of their licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
We are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection, data security and safeguarding. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.
We are subject to diverse laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security, including the United Kingdom data protection regime consisting primarily of the UK General Data Protection Regulation and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and, in the EEA, Regulation 2016/679, known as the EEA General Data Protection Regulation. In key jurisdictions where we operate, including China, Singapore and Thailand, new global privacy rules are being enacted and existing ones are being updated and strengthened. We are likely to be required to expend significant capital and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance with these laws and regulations. Claims that we have violated individuals’ privacy rights or breached our data protection obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.
We collect and process personal data from our followers, customers, members, suppliers, business contacts and employees as part of the operation of our business (including online merchandising), and therefore we must comply with data protection and privacy laws in the United Kingdom and, in certain situations, other jurisdictions where we operate or where our followers reside. The United Kingdom’s data protection regime imposes stringent operational requirements for controllers of personal data, including, for example, higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data (including, in certain circumstances for marketing and other follower engagement), more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for data breach notifications,
13

limitations on retention of information, additional obligations when we contract third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data, and certain restrictions when transferring personal data outside of the UK. The EEA General Data Protection Regulation imposes similarly onerous obligations for our operations in the EEA. In addition, we are exposed to the risk that the personal data we control could be wrongfully accessed and/or used, whether by employees, followers or other third parties, or otherwise lost or disclosed or processed in breach of data protection regulations. If we or any of the third-party service providers on which we rely fail to process such personal data in a lawful or secure manner or if any theft or loss of personal data were to occur, we could face liability under data protection laws, and we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, enforcement notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data and/or fines of up to £17.5 million (in the UK)/20 million Euros (in the EU) or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. In addition to statutory enforcement and other administrative penalties, a personal data breach can lead to compensation claims by affected individuals, negative publicity and a potential loss of business.
In recent years, US and European lawmakers and regulators have expressed concern over electronic marketing and the use of third-party cookies, web beacons and similar technology for online behavioral advertising. In the United Kingdom, marketing is defined broadly to include any promotional material and the rules specifically on electronic marketing are currently set out in the ePrivacy Directive (which is implemented in the United Kingdom by the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations; this remains in force following the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union), which requires informed consent for the placement of a cookie or similar technologies on a user’s device and for certain direct electronic marketing. The regime also imposes conditions on obtaining valid consent, such as a prohibition on pre-checked consents and a requirement to ensure separate consents are sought for each type of cookie or similar technology, and non-compliance with marketing and cookies laws could lead to litigation, regulatory investigations, enforcement notices or monetary penalties. Further regulation or more stringent enforcement of cookies and similar technologies, and any decline of cookies or similar online tracking technologies as a means to identify and potentially target users, may lead to broader restrictions on our online activities, including efforts to understand followers’ internet usage and promote ourselves to them.
We are also subject to legislation associated with child protection, adult protection, safeguarding and the rights of children. We aim to operate in compliance with the guiding principles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (“UNCRC”) which sets out the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of every child, regardless of their race, religion or abilities.
Both in the United Kingdom and internationally there have been increases in disclosures of institutional sexual abuse, most notably by the Football Association (England), US Gymnastics (USA) and Oxfam (Haiti/ United Kingdom), where the outcome has been significant fines, reductions in funding and sponsorship, and substantial media reputational damage along with a lack of trust in those organizations. We are required to demonstrate to government and regulatory bodies our processes and systems to demonstrate what proactive steps we take to ensure the safety and well-being of children and adults at risk in our duty of care, as well as managing any civil liability or other claims by individuals against historical abuse disclosures.
We collect, process and retain personal data associated with safeguarding cases and criminal records in order to take steps to safeguard children and adults at risk, and create a safer culture for them to thrive and for staff/volunteers to work within, in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements. Safeguarding legislation is in flux with the key focus that the welfare of the child and/or adult at risk is paramount. Failure to maintain compliance with these changes could harm our business.
Piracy and illegal live streaming may adversely impact our Broadcasting revenue.
For each of the years ended 30 June 2022, 2021 and 2020, Broadcasting revenue constituted 36.8%, 51.6% and 27.6%, respectively, of our total revenue. Our Broadcasting revenue is principally generated by the broadcasting of our matches on pay and free-to-air television channels as well as content delivered over the internet and through our own television channel, MUTV. In recent years, piracy and illegal live streaming of subscription content over the internet has caused, and is continuing to cause, lost revenue to media distributors showing our matches. For example, the Premier League previously initiated litigation against Google and YouTube for facilitating piracy and illegal streaming of subscription content. While this litigation matter has been settled there can be no guarantee that this or similar actions will prevent or limit
14

future piracy or illegal streaming of subscription content. If these trends increase or continue unabated, they could pose a risk to subscription television services. The result could be a reduction in the value of our share of football broadcasting rights and of our online and MUTV services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
Changes in consumer viewing habits and the emergence of new content distribution platforms could adversely affect our business.
The manner in which consumers view televised sporting events is changing rapidly with the emergence of alternative distribution platforms. Digital cable, internet and wireless content providers are continuing to improve technologies, content offerings, user interface, and business models that allow consumers to access video-on-demand or internet-based tools with interactive capabilities including start, stop and rewind. Such developments may impact the profitability or effectiveness of our existing media contracts and strategy, including our television channel, MUTV. If we are unsuccessful in adapting our licensing practices and/or media platforms as consumer viewing habits change, our viewership levels (whether on traditional or new platforms), our Broadcasting revenue and/or the value of our advertising and sponsorship contracts may decrease, which could have a material adverse effect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
In addition, even if we are able to successfully adapt, we will be subject to risks associated with these alternative distribution platforms. Delivery of video programming over the internet is done through a series of carriers, and any point of failure in this distribution chain may disrupt or degrade the quality of our services. Service disruption or degradation for any reason, including as a result of a cyber-attack, natural disaster or other failure in our or a third-party’s IT systems, could diminish the overall attractiveness of our services to subscribers, causing us to lose subscribers and/or credit subscribers affected by such disruption, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our operating results may fluctuate due to seasonality.
Our operating results are subject to seasonal variation, limiting the overall comparability and predictability of interim financial periods. The seasonality of our operating results is primarily attributable to the number of games played in each financial period and therefore Matchday and Broadcasting revenue recognized. Similarly, certain of our costs derive from hosting games at Old Trafford, and these costs will also vary based on the number of games played in the period. We have historically generated higher revenue in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year. Our business might be affected by our men’s first team reaching the later stages of European and domestic competitions, which would generally generate significant additional Broadcasting and Matchday revenue during the fourth quarter of our fiscal years. Our cash flow may also vary among interim periods due to the timing of significant payments from major commercial and player transfer agreements. The seasonality we have experienced in our business, as described above, has been, and may continue to be, further exaggerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, our interim results and any quarterly financial information that we publish should not be viewed as an indicator of our performance for the fiscal year.
We are subject to tax in multiple jurisdictions, and changes in tax laws (or in the interpretations thereof) in the United States, United Kingdom or in other jurisdictions could have an adverse effect on us.
Although we are incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company, we report as a US domestic corporation for US federal income tax purposes and we are subject to US federal corporate income tax (currently at a statutory rate of 21%) on our worldwide income. As the majority of the Group is UK tax resident, then we are also subject to UK corporation tax (currently at a statutory rate of 19% but due to increase to 25% from April 2023). We expect to utilize a credit in the United States for UK taxes paid and therefore we do not expect to be double taxed on our income.
In addition, we are subject to income and other taxes in various other jurisdictions. The amount of tax we pay is subject to our interpretation and application of tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in current or future laws or regulations, or the imposition of new or changed tax laws or regulations or new related interpretations by taxing authorities in the US, UK or foreign jurisdictions, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. For example, on August 16, 2022,
15

President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, which introduced a corporate minimum tax that would be imposed on certain corporations at a 15% rate and an excise tax of 1% that would, in some cases, be imposed on stock buybacks and stock redemptions by corporations. These changes could impact our tax liabilities and the recognition of the US deferred tax asset in the future, among other impacts. The Internal Revenue Service or other authorities may also issue regulations or other guidance in the future that could modify how these taxes or other provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act will be applied. In addition, other changes to the US federal tax law have also been proposed from time to time; however, it is not yet clear if or what additional changes will be made or when, or what impact any such changes will have on us.
We establish tax provisions, where appropriate, on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to (and recovered from) tax authorities and, as a result, changes in tax laws (or in the interpretations thereof) could have an adverse effect on us.
Tax is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where we operate and generate taxable income. We establish provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to (or recovered from) the tax authorities. From time to time we are involved in discussions with tax authorities in relation to ongoing tax matters and, where appropriate, provisions are made based on our assessment of each case. We are currently in active discussions with UK tax authorities over a number of tax areas in relation to arrangements with players and players’ representatives. It is possible that in the future, as a result of these discussions, as well as discussions that UK tax authorities are holding with other stakeholders within the football industry, interpretations of applicable rules will be challenged, which could result in liabilities in relation to these matters. The future income tax expense or credit may be higher or lower than estimates made when we determined whether it was appropriate to record a provision and the amount to be recorded. Furthermore, changes in the legislative framework or applicable tax case law (or in the interpretation thereof) could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
Business interruptions due to natural disasters, terrorist incidents and other events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or any other pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, could adversely affect us and Old Trafford.
Our operations can be subject to natural disasters, terrorist incidents and other events beyond our control, such as earthquakes, fires, power failures, telecommunication losses, acts of war and pandemics, epidemics or any other outbreak of an infectious disease, including fluctuations in the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and any resulting restrictions on business activity and operations, which may vary significantly by country and/or region. Such events, whether natural or manmade, could cause severe destruction or interruption to our operations, and as a result, our business could suffer serious harm. Our men’s first team regularly tours the world for promotional matches, visiting various countries with a history of terrorism and civil unrest, and as a result, we and our players could be potential targets of terrorism when visiting such countries. In addition, any prolonged business interruption at Old Trafford could cause a decline in Matchday revenue. See “—The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.” Our business interruption insurance only covers some, but not all, of these potential events, and even for those events that are covered, it may not be sufficient to compensate us fully for losses or damages that may occur as a result of such events, including, for example, loss of market share and diminution of our brand, reputation and client loyalty. Any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and cash flow.
We are subject to risks relating to weather and climate change.
Extreme weather conditions may cause property damage or interrupt our matchday operations both at Old Trafford and at other away match locations, which could harm our business and results of operations. Climate change may affect the frequency or severity of these conditions. Our property and business interruption insurance coverage for certain conditions is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits, including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect, if at all, on claims resulting from such conditions.
16

If we fail to properly manage our anticipated growth, our business could suffer.
The planned growth of our commercial operations may place a significant strain on our management and on our operational and financial resources and systems. To manage growth effectively, we will need to maintain a system of management controls and attract and retain qualified personnel, as well as, develop, train and manage management-level and other employees. Failure to manage our growth effectively could cause us to over-invest or under-invest in infrastructure, and result in losses or weaknesses in our infrastructure, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Any failure by us to manage our growth effectively could have a negative effect on our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals and strategies.
Non-compliance with health and safety legislation could lead to physical harm.
The safety, health, and well-being of all our employees and customers is fundamental to delivering sustainable and positive economic performance. We are obligated to comply with various rules and conditions imposed by government and regulatory bodies, including but not limited to those set out by the Sports Ground Safety Authority (SGSA), ISO 45001: 2018 certification (Health & Safety Management Standard), fire safety measures and our requirement to maintain compliance with COVID-19 protocols on both matchday and non-matchday. Any incident involving non-compliance with respect to health and safety could potentially not only affect staff but also others at the stadium including contractors, fans and visitors. Depending on the severity of the non-compliance and the impact on those affected parties, this could lead to possible accident or injury claims, fines, damage to the brand and reputation and prosecution, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. In an effort to mitigate these risks, we have dedicated significant resources to establishing health and safety operational policies and procedures, ongoing employee training protocols, and both monthly/annual compliance and affirmation reporting obligations. Incidents involving non-compliance may still occur despite our efforts, and it is possible that these and any similar actions we may take in the future to mitigate these risks may divert resources away from our revenue-generating activities without yielding a corresponding benefit.
Risks Related to Our Industry
An economic downturn or other adverse economic conditions may harm our business.
Economic downturns and other adverse conditions in the United Kingdom and markets globally, including the current economic downturn and adverse conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and other economic pressures, have negatively affected, and any further downturns or other adverse conditions that occur in the future may also negatively affect, our operations. Our Matchday and Broadcasting revenue in part depend on personal disposable income and corporate marketing and hospitality budgets. Further, our Commercial revenue is contingent upon the expenditures of businesses across a wide range of industries. Any economic downturn or other deterioration in economic conditions, such as inflation, slower growth, unemployment levels, credit availability, fuel prices, interest rates, tax rates, trade relations and regulations, or other factors, whether resulting from geopolitical issues and uncertainty, the impact of pandemics, epidemics or other outbreaks of infectious disease, or any number of other conditions or events outside of our control, are likely to have a negative impact on consumer and corporate discretionary spending and otherwise lead companies in affected industries to cut costs in response to these changed circumstances. As a result, any economic downturn or other weakening in economic conditions could cause a reduction in our Commercial revenue, as well as our Broadcasting and Matchday revenue, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
The departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union may adversely affect our operations and financial results.
The United Kingdom formally withdrew from the EU on 31 January 2020 and entered into a transition period which ended on 31 December 2020. While a number of significant agreements were ratified during the transitional period or shortly thereafter, there remains a degree of political and economic uncertainty regarding whether the terms of these new relationships will differ materially from the terms prior to withdrawal.
17

These developments may continue to impact the economic outlook of the EU and the United Kingdom, and associated global implications remain uncertain. Lack of clarity about future UK laws and regulations could decrease foreign direct investment in the United Kingdom, increase costs, depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and the price of our Class A ordinary shares.
Furthermore, following the departure of the United Kingdom from the EU, there are greater restrictions on the movement of players (and football technical staff including Head Coaches) between the United Kingdom and EU member states, and other increased regulatory complexities. Any EU resident player or technical staff that the club is seeking to employ must now be granted a Governing Body Endorsement (“GBE”) from The Football Association. The FA will grant a GBE automatically if certain “auto-pass” criteria are met which for players is based on their record of senior international appearances, typically reviewed over a 2-year period and the auto-pass thresholds being determined by the FIFA ranking of the player’s national association. If the player does not meet the auto-pass threshold, a points system based on a number of football-related criteria (in addition to senior international appearances) is used to determine whether a GBE will be granted.
In addition to EU resident football players now requiring a GBE (similar to other workers not entitled to work in the UK), the departure of the United Kingdom means we are no longer able to rely on the exemption that permits the transfer of players between the ages of 16 and 18 within the territory of the EU or the EEA (subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions) as an exception to the FIFA rules which prohibit the international transfer of players under the age of 18 (subject to certain limited exceptions).
An increase in the relative size of salaries or transfer costs could adversely affect our business.
Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain the highest quality players and coaching staff. As a result, we are obliged to pay salaries generally comparable to our main competitors in England and Europe. Any increase in salaries may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
Other factors that affect player salaries, such as changes in personal tax rates, changes to the treatment of income or other changes to taxation in the United Kingdom and the relative strength of pounds sterling, may make it more difficult to attract top players and coaching staff from Europe or elsewhere or require us to pay higher salaries to compensate for higher taxes or less favorable exchange rates. In addition, if our revenue falls and salaries remain stable (for example, as a result of fixed player or coaching staff salaries over a long period) or increase, our results of operations would be materially adversely affected.
An increase in transfer fees would require us to pay more than expected for the acquisition of players’ registrations in the future. In addition, certain players’ transfer values may diminish after we acquire them, and we may sell those players for transfer fees below their net book value, resulting in a loss on disposal of players’ registrations. Net transfer costs could also increase if levies imposed by FIFA, the Premier League or any other organization in respect of the transfer of players’ registrations were to increase.
We remain committed to attracting and retaining the highest quality players and key football management staff for our men’s first team. Our average annual net registrations cash outflow over the last five years has been £120.4 million and we continue to expect it to vary significantly from period to period. We may explore new player acquisitions in connection with future transfer periods that may materially increase the amount of our net capital expenditure on intangible assets. As part of any material increase in net capital expenditure on intangible assets, we may also experience a material increase in our expenditure for player salaries. The actual amount of cash we use on player acquisitions will also depend, in part, on the amount of any cash we receive as a result of the sale of any players. Any increase in net capital expenditure on intangible assets compared to historic levels will also result in an increase in amortization expenses in future periods.
UEFA, Premier League and FIFA regulations could negatively affect our business.
As the primary governing body of European football, UEFA continually evaluates the dynamics in the football industry and considers changes to the regulatory framework governing European football clubs.
18

Clubs participating in UEFA club competitions are subject to the UEFA Club Licensing and Sustainability regulations. Breaches in the rules may result in, among other things, withholding of prize money, bans on registering new players for UEFA club competitions and ultimately disqualification from UEFA club competitions. Amongst other things, these rules are intended to discourage clubs from continually operating at a loss and to ensure that clubs settle their football, staff and tax creditors on time. Participating clubs were previously subject to Financial Fair Play (“FFP”) regulations where relevant costs (which includes all wage costs and the amortization of player capital expenditures, but excludes depreciation of tangible fixed assets, youth development, women’s team and community expenditure) exceed revenues on a cumulative basis over a three-year period, or serious delays in settling creditors. Breaches have resulted in clubs being punished by way of significant fines and even exclusion from UEFA club competitions. The rules have been amended, effective from 1 July 2022, to include a squad cost rule, with the existing “break-even” rule remaining in place. The new regulations will see clubs subject to squad cost controls for the first time. The cost control rule restricts spending on player and coach wages, transfers, and agent fees to 70% of club revenues. Revenue includes operating revenue and an average of the previous 36 months of player trading result. The gradual implementation will see the percentage at 90% in 2023/24, 80% in 2024/25, and 70% from 2025/26 onwards.
The Premier League also operates under regulations that aim to promote sustainability through profitability. The Premier League Profitability and Sustainability Rules contain a break-even test, similar to that in UEFA’s regulations. Our most recent submission was based on the fiscal years ended 30 June 2021 and 2020 and provided a positive result. Wide-ranging sanctions, including significant fines, player transfer restrictions and Premier League points deduction, may be imposed by the Premier League for a breach of these regulations.
There is a risk that application of the UEFA Financial Sustainability regulations and Premier League Profitability and Sustainability Rules could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our men’s first team and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
The club is also bound by FIFA and Premier League regulations in respect of the status and transfer of players’ registrations across all age groups internationally and domestically. Sanctions for significant non-compliance or breaches could include restrictions on incoming player transfers and monetary fines, which could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our men’s first team and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
We could be negatively affected by current and future Premier League, FA, UEFA, FIFA or other regulations.
Future changes to the Premier League, FA, UEFA, FIFA or other regulations may adversely affect our results of operations. These regulations could cover various aspects of our business, such as the format of competitions, the eligibility of players, the operation of the transfer market and the distribution of Broadcasting revenue. FIFA is currently going through a process of reforming the regulations which govern the transfer of player registrations, including: (a) how clubs involved in the training of a professional player are compensated for their contribution to the development of that player when that player’s registration is transferred from one club to another; (b) the transfer of players on a temporary basis (so-called player loans); and (c) the activities and remuneration of intermediaries (so-called football agents) with respect to player transfers. It is possible that this regulatory reform will impact our ability to acquire players and/or increase our costs with respect to the recruitment and retention of players. In addition, changes are being considered to address the financial sustainability of clubs such as more robust ownership rules and tests in relation to board directors and significant shareholders. In particular, changes to football regulations designed to promote competition could have a significant impact on our business. Such changes could include changes to the distribution of broadcasting income and changes to the relegation structure of English football. In addition, rules designed to promote the development of local players, such as the Home-Grown Player Rule, which requires each Premier League club to include at least eight “home grown” (i.e., players that have been registered for at least three seasons at an English or Welsh club between the ages of 16 and 21) players in their squads, could limit our ability to select players. Any of these changes could make it more difficult for us to acquire top quality players and, therefore, adversely affect the performance of our men’s first team.
19

Changes in the format of the league and cup competitions in which our men’s first team plays, or might in the future play, could have a negative impact on our results of operations. In addition, in the event that new competitions are introduced to replace existing competitions (for example, a European league), our results of operations may be negatively affected.
Changes in the wider regulatory framework for English football could impact our business, following the Fan-led Review of Football Governance initiated by the UK Government in April 2021. Preliminary findings from the Review were published in July 2021 and included a recommendation for the creation of an Independent Regulator for English Football, established by legislation, to take over some responsibilities currently held by the FA. It was proposed that such a body would likely oversee matters, including financial regulation, corporate governance and ownership. In April 2022, the UK Government indicated their intention to introduce an independent regulator and consultations on this matter are ongoing.
While the Club has positively engaged with the Review and supports many of its objectives, the creation of an Independent Regulator could result in new restrictions and requirements for our business. These could include cost controls, minimum governance standards and revised tests for owners and directors.
There could be a decline in our popularity or the popularity of football.
There can be no assurance that football will retain its popularity as a sport around the world and its status in the United Kingdom as the so-called “national game,” together with the associated levels of media coverage. In addition, we could suffer a decline in popularity. Any decline in popularity could result in lower ticket sales, Broadcasting revenue, sponsorship revenue, a reduction in the value of our players or our brand, or a decline in the value of our securities, including our Class A ordinary shares. Any one of these events or a combination of such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
Risk Related to Our Indebtedness
Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and competitive position.
As of 30 June 2022, we had total indebtedness of £636.1 million. Our indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. It could also have effects on our business. For example, it could:
• limit our ability to pay dividends;
• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
• require us to dedicate a material portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund the hiring and retention of players and coaching staff, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;
• limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the football industry;
• affect our ability to compete for players and coaching staff; and
• limit our ability to borrow additional funds.
In addition, our revolving facilities, our secured term loan facility and the note purchase agreement governing the senior secured notes contain, and any agreements evidencing or governing other future indebtedness may contain, certain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in certain activities that are in our long-term best interests. See “—Our indebtedness may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.” We have not previously breached and are not in breach of any of the covenants under any of these facilities; however our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness.
To service our indebtedness, we require cash, and our ability to generate cash is subject to many factors beyond our control.
Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to
20

the performance and popularity of our men’s first team as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, including the COVID-19 pandemic and any other pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease.
We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to refinance our indebtedness on terms we believe to be acceptable could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
Our indebtedness may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.
Our revolving facilities, our secured term loan facility and the note purchase agreement governing the senior secured notes limit our ability, among other things, to:
• incur additional indebtedness;
• pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our shares;
• make investments;
• sell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;
• enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;
• consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;
• enter into sale and leaseback transactions;
• enter into transactions with our affiliates; and
• incur liens.
Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of these covenants or restrictions, we could be in default under our revolving facilities, our secured term loan facility and the note purchase agreement governing the senior secured notes. This would permit the lending banks under our revolving facilities and our secured term loan facility to take certain actions, including declaring all amounts that we have borrowed under our revolving facilities, secured term loan facility and other indebtedness to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. This would also result in an event of default under the note purchase agreement governing the senior secured notes. Furthermore, lending banks could refuse to extend further credit under the revolving facilities. If the debt under our revolving facilities, our secured term loan facility, the note purchase agreement governing the senior secured notes or any other material financing arrangement that we enter into were to be accelerated, our assets, in particular liquid assets, may be insufficient to repay our indebtedness. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly, as well as risks related to the phasing out of LIBOR.
We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our revolving facilities and our secured term loan facility, which bear interest at variable rates. Interest rate changes could impact the amount of our interest payments, and accordingly, our future earnings and cash flow, assuming other factors are held constant. We have entered into an interest rate swap related to a portion of our secured term loan facility that involves the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. As of 30 June 2022, we had £185.2 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding under our secured term loan facility and £100.0 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding under our revolving facilities. We cannot assure you that any hedging activities entered into by us will be effective in fully mitigating our interest rate risk from our variable rate indebtedness.
In addition, the interest rate benchmarks that we are subject to may change as a result of regulatory guidance and/or reform. From 1 January 2022, the GBP London Inter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) in
21

addition to 1-week and 2-month USD LIBOR rates were replaced by SONIA (Sterling Overnight Average Index) and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) respectively and all other USD LIBOR rates will cease immediately after 30 June 2023. While the agreements governing our revolving facilities have been amended to replace LIBOR with SONIA and SOFR based rates as applicable and the secured term loan facility provides for an alternate method of calculating our interest rates in the event that a LIBOR rate is unavailable, when all remaining LIBOR rates cease to exist or when the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, there may be adverse impacts on the financial markets generally and interest rates on borrowings under our revolving facilities and secured term loan facility may be materially adversely affected.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Ordinary Shares
Because of their increased voting rights, the holders of our Class B shares will be able to exert control over us and our significant corporate decisions.
Trusts and other entities controlled by six lineal descendants of Mr. Malcolm Glazer collectively own 4.37% of our issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares and all of our issued and outstanding Class B ordinary shares, representing 95.62% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. See “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—A. Major Shareholders.” Each Class A ordinary share is entitled to one vote per share and is not convertible into any other class of shares. Each Class B ordinary share is entitled to 10 votes per share and is convertible into one Class A ordinary share at any time. In addition, our Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares upon certain transfers and other events, including upon the date when holders of all Class B ordinary shares cease to hold Class B ordinary shares representing at least 10% of the total number of Class A and Class B ordinary shares outstanding. For special resolutions, which require the vote of two-thirds of the votes cast, at any time that Class B ordinary shares remain outstanding, the voting power permitted to be exercised by the holders of the Class B ordinary shares will be weighted such that the Class B ordinary shares shall represent, in the aggregate, 67% of the voting power of all shareholders. As a result, the holders of our Class B shares will be able to exert a significant degree of influence or actual control over our management and affairs and control all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. The interests of the holders of our Class B shares might not coincide with the interests of the other shareholders. This concentration of voting power in our Class B shares may harm the value of our Class A ordinary shares, among other things:
• delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company;
• impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving our Company; or
• causing us to enter into transactions or agreements that are not in the best interests of all shareholders.
As a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange’s corporate governance rules, we are permitted to, and we do, rely on exemptions from certain of the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards and shareholder approval requirements. Our reliance on such exemptions may afford less protection to holders of our Class A ordinary shares.
The New York Stock Exchange’s corporate governance rules require listed companies to have, among other things, a majority of independent board members and independent director oversight of executive compensation, nomination of directors and corporate governance matters. Additionally, the New York Stock Exchange’s rules require that a listed company obtain, in specified circumstances, (1) shareholder approval to adopt and materially revise equity compensation plans, as well as (2) shareholder approval prior to an issuance (a) of more than 1% of its common stock (including derivative securities thereof) in either number or voting power to related parties, (b) of more than 20% of its outstanding common stock (including derivative securities thereof) in either number or voting power or (c) that would result in a change of control. As a foreign private issuer, we are permitted to, and we do, follow home country practice in lieu of the foregoing requirements. As long as we rely on the foreign private issuer exemptions under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, a majority of the directors on our board of directors are not required to be
22

independent directors, our remuneration committee is not required to be comprised entirely of independent directors, we are not required to have a nominating and corporate governance committee, and shareholder approval is neither required for equity compensation plans and material revisions to those plans nor the issuance of more than 1% of our outstanding ordinary shares (including derivative securities thereof) in either number or voting power, the issuance of 20% or more of our outstanding ordinary shares (including derivative securities thereof) in either number or voting power or an issuance that would result in a change of control. Therefore, our board of directors’ approach to governance and securities issuances may be different from that of a board of directors consisting of a majority of independent directors, and, as a result, the management oversight of our Company may be more limited than if we were subject to all of the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards and shareholder approval requirements.
Accordingly, our shareholders do not have the same protection afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards and shareholder approval requirements, and the ability of our independent directors to influence our business policies and affairs may be reduced.
The obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention.
As a public company in the United States, we incur legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not previously incur as a private company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “SarbanesOxley Act”), the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations increases our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increases demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of such internal control. Even if our management concludes that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may decline to attest to our management’s assessment or may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our internal controls or the level at which such controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us. Failure to comply with Section 404 could subject us to regulatory scrutiny and sanctions, impair our ability to generate revenue, cause investors to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and negatively affect our share price.
Furthermore, the demands of being a public company may divert management’s attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to continue to meet our reporting obligations as a public company. However, the measures we have taken, and will continue to take, may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. In addition, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These additional obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to continue to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses
23

and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected.
We may lose our foreign private issuer status in the future, which could result in significant additional costs and expenses.
We are a “foreign private issuer,” as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act, and therefore, we are not required to comply with all the periodic disclosure and current reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and related rules and regulations. Under Rule 405, the determination of foreign private issuer status is made annually on the last business day of an issuer’s most recently completed second fiscal quarter and, accordingly, the next determination will be made with respect to us on 31 December 2022.
In the future, we would lose our foreign private issuer status if a majority of our shareholders, directors or management are US citizens or residents and we fail to meet additional requirements necessary to avoid loss of foreign private issuer status. Although we have elected to comply with certain US regulatory provisions, our loss of foreign private issuer status would make such provisions mandatory. The regulatory and compliance costs to us under US securities laws as a US domestic issuer may be significantly higher. If we are not a foreign private issuer, we will be required to file periodic reports and registration statements on US domestic issuer forms with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which are more detailed and extensive than the forms available to a foreign private issuer. For example, the annual report on Form 10-K requires domestic issuers to disclose executive compensation information on an individual basis with specific disclosure regarding the domestic compensation philosophy, objectives, annual total compensation (base salary, bonus, equity compensation) and potential payments in connection with change in control, retirement, death or disability, while the annual report on Form 20-F permits foreign private issuers to disclose compensation information on an aggregate basis. We will also have to mandatorily comply with US federal proxy requirements, and our officers, directors and principal shareholders will become subject to the short-swing profit disclosure and recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. We may also be required to modify certain of our policies to comply with good governance practices associated with US domestic issuers. Such conversion and modifications will involve additional costs. In addition, we may lose our ability to rely upon exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements on US stock exchanges that are available to foreign private issuers.
Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Cayman Islands law may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders, which could depress the price of our Class A ordinary shares and prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management.
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that shareholders may consider to be in their best interests. In particular, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association permit our board of directors to issue preference shares from time to time, with such rights and preferences as they consider appropriate. Our board of directors could also authorize the issuance of preference shares with terms and conditions and under circumstances that could have an effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction. We are also subject to certain provisions under Cayman Islands law which could delay or prevent a change of control. In particular, any merger, consolidation or amalgamation of the Company would require the active consent of our board of directors. Our board of directors may be appointed or removed by the holders of the majority of the voting power of our ordinary shares (which is controlled by the holders of our Class B ordinary shares). Together these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our Class A ordinary shares.
24

The price of our Class A ordinary shares might fluctuate significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
Volatility in the market price of our Class A ordinary shares may prevent investors from being able to sell their Class A ordinary shares at or above the price they paid for such shares. The trading price of our Class A ordinary shares may be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, including:
• performance of our men’s first team;
• the overall performance of the equity markets;
• industry related regulatory developments;
• issuance of new or changed securities analysts’ reports or recommendations;
• additions or departures of key personnel;
• investor perceptions of us and the football industry, changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;
• sale of our Class A ordinary shares by us, our principal shareholders or members of our management;
• general economic conditions, including the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and any other pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease;
• changes in interest rates; and
• availability of capital.
These and other factors might cause the market price of our Class A ordinary shares to fluctuate substantially, which might limit or prevent investors from readily selling their Class A ordinary shares and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Class A ordinary shares. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies across many industries. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Accordingly, the price of our Class A ordinary shares could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our Company, and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company’s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs, divert our management’s attention and resources, and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
Future sales of our Class A ordinary shares, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.
Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A ordinary shares, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our Class A ordinary shares and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares. As of 2 September 2022 we had 54,537,360 Class A ordinary shares outstanding. The Class A ordinary shares are freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for any of our Class A ordinary shares that may be held or acquired by our directors, executive officers and other affiliates, as that term is defined in the Securities Act, which will be restricted securities under the Securities Act. Restricted securities may not be sold in the public market unless the sale is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration is available.
All of our Class A ordinary shares outstanding as of the date of this Annual Report may be sold in the public market by existing shareholders, subject to applicable Rule 144 volume limitations and other limitations imposed under federal securities laws.
In the future, we may also issue our securities if we need to raise capital in connection with a capital raise or acquisition. The amount of our Class A ordinary shares issued in connection with a capital raise or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding Class A ordinary shares.
25

Our ability to pay regular dividends is subject to restrictions in our revolving facilities, our secured term loan facility, the note purchase agreement governing the senior secured notes, results of operations, distributable reserves and solvency requirements; our Class A ordinary shares have no guaranteed dividends and holders of our Class A ordinary shares have no recourse if dividends are not declared.
In fiscal year 2022, we paid three cash dividends on our Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares, each of $0.09 per share. Dividends paid in the year ended 30 June 2022 amounted to $44.0 million ($0.27 per share), the pounds sterling equivalent of which was £33.6 million (£0.21 per share). The declaration and payment of any future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors or a committee thereof and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, distributable reserves, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, capital requirements and other factors our board of directors (or such committee thereof) deems relevant. Furthermore, neither our Class A ordinary shares nor our Class B ordinary shares have any guaranteed dividends and holders of our Class A ordinary shares and holders of our Class B ordinary shares have no recourse if dividends are not declared. Our ability to pay dividends on the Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares is limited by our revolving facilities, our secured term loan facility and the note purchase agreement governing the senior secured notes, which contain restricted payment covenants. The restricted payment covenants allow dividends in certain circumstances, including to the extent dividends do not exceed 50% of the cumulative consolidated net income of Red Football Limited and its restricted subsidiaries, provided there is no event of default and Red Football Limited is able to meet the principal and interest payments on its debt under a fixed charge coverage test. Our ability to pay dividends may be further restricted by the terms of any of our future debt or preferred securities. Additionally, because we are a holding company, our ability to pay dividends on our Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares is limited by restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us, including restrictions under the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness. As a consequence of these limitations and restrictions, we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce or eliminate, the payment of dividends on our Class A ordinary shares. Accordingly, you may have to sell some or all of your Class A ordinary shares after price appreciation in order to generate cash flow from your investment. You may not receive a gain on your investment when you sell your Class A ordinary shares and you may lose the entire amount of the investment. Additionally, any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect the market price of our Class A ordinary shares. See “Item 8. Financial Information—A. Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information—Dividend Policy.”
The rules of the Premier League and our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association impose certain limitations on shareholders’ ability to invest in more than one football club.
The rules of the Premier League prohibit any person who holds an interest of 10% or more of the total voting rights exercisable in a Premier League or English Football League (“EFL”) football club from holding an interest in voting rights exercisable in any other Premier League football club or EFL football club. As a result, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association prohibit the acquisition of (i) 10% or more of our Class A ordinary shares if they hold any interest in voting rights exercisable in another Premier League football club and (ii) any Class A ordinary shares if they hold an interest of 10% or more of the total voting rights exercisable in another Premier League football club. In addition, under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, if any shareholder is determined by us, at our absolute discretion, to be holding any Class A ordinary shares in violation of this rule or the rules of certain other relevant governing bodies, we have the right to repurchase shares from such person or direct that shareholder to transfer those shares to another person.
Exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the foreign exchange value of the Class A ordinary shares and any dividends.
Our Class A ordinary shares are quoted in US dollars on the New York Stock Exchange. Our financial statements are prepared in pounds sterling. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the pounds sterling and the US dollar will affect, among other matters, the US dollar value of the Class A ordinary shares and of any dividends.
26

The rights afforded to shareholders are governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands.
Our corporate affairs and the rights afforded to shareholders are governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and by the Companies Law (as amended) of the Cayman Islands (the “Companies Law”) and common law of the Cayman Islands, and these rights differ in certain respects from the rights of shareholders in typical US corporations. In particular, the laws of the Cayman Islands relating to the protection of the interests of minority shareholders differ in some respects from those established under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in the United States. The laws of the Cayman Island provide only limited circumstances under which shareholders of companies may bring derivative actions and (except in limited circumstances) do not afford appraisal rights to dissenting shareholders in the form typically available to shareholders of a US corporation other than in limited circumstances in relation to certain mergers. A summary of Cayman Islands law on the protection of minority shareholders is set out in “Item 10. Additional Information—B. Memorandum and Articles of Association and Other Share Information.”
We report as a US domestic corporation for US federal corporate income tax purposes.
As discussed more fully under “Item 10. Additional Information—E. Taxation,” due to the circumstances of our formation and the application of Section 7874 of the Code, we report as a US domestic corporation for all purposes of the Code. As a result, we are subject to US federal income tax on our worldwide income. In addition, if we pay dividends to a Non-US Holder, as defined in the discussion “Item 10. Additional Information—E. Taxation,” we will be required to withhold US federal income tax at the rate of 30%, or such lower rate as may be provided in an applicable income tax treaty. Each investor should consult its own tax adviser regarding the US federal income tax position of the Company and the tax consequences of holding the Class A ordinary shares.
Withholding under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act may apply to our dividends.
Under legislation incorporating provisions referred to as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”), a 30% withholding tax will generally apply to certain types of payments, including US source dividends made to “foreign financial institutions” (as defined under those rules) and certain other non-US entities, unless such foreign financial institutions or other entities comply with requirements under FATCA. Because we report as a US domestic corporation for all purposes of the Code, including for purposes of FATCA, our dividends paid to a foreign financial institution or other non-US entity may be subject to potential withholding under FATCA. Under the applicable US Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance, withholding under FATCA generally applies to payments of dividends on our Class A ordinary shares. While withholding under FATCA would have also applied to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of stock on or after 1 January 2019, proposed Treasury Regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross proceeds entirely. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed Treasury Regulations until final Treasury Regulations are issued.
If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
The trading market for our Class A ordinary shares depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business or our industry. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock, our share price will likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to publish regular reports on us, interest in the purchase of our Class A ordinary shares could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
It may be difficult to enforce a US judgment against us, our directors and officers and certain experts named in this Annual Report outside the United States, or to assert US securities law claims outside of the United States.
The majority of our directors and executive officers are not residents of the United States, and the majority of our assets and the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for investors to effect service of process upon us within the United States or other jurisdictions, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. Additionally, it may be difficult to assert US securities law claims in actions
27

originally instituted outside of the United States. Foreign courts may refuse to hear a US securities law claim because foreign courts may not be the most appropriate forums in which to bring such a claim. Even if a foreign court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that the law of the jurisdiction in which the foreign court resides, and not US law, is applicable to the claim. Further, if US law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable US law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process, and certain matters of procedure would still be governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the foreign court resides.
In particular, investors should be aware that there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands would recognize and enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us or our directors or management as well as against the selling shareholder predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States or entertain original actions brought in the Cayman Islands courts against us or our directors or officers as well as against the selling shareholder predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States. As a result of the difficulty associated with enforcing a judgment against us, you may not be able to collect any damages awarded by either a US or foreign court.
ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY
Our Company—Manchester United
Manchester United Ltd., an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the Companies Law (as amended) of the Cayman Islands, was incorporated on 30 April 2012. On 8 August 2012, Manchester United Ltd. changed its legal name to Manchester United plc. The principal executive office address is Sir Matt Busby Way, Old Trafford, Manchester M16 0RA, United Kingdom.
The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy statements and other information about issuers, like us, that file electronically with the SEC. The address of that site is www.sec.gov. We also make available on our website, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 20-F and the text of our reports on Form 6-K, including any amendments to these reports, as well as certain other SEC filings, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Our website address is https://ir.manutd.com/. The information contained on or through our website, or any other website referred to herein, is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report.
We are one of the most popular and successful sports teams in the world, playing one of the most popular spectator sports on Earth. Through our 144-year heritage we have won 66 trophies, including a record 20 English league titles, enabling us to develop what we believe is one of the world’s leading sports brands and a global community of 1.1 billion fans and followers. Our large, passionate community provides us with a worldwide platform to generate significant revenue from multiple sources, including sponsorship, merchandising, product licensing, broadcasting and Matchday. We attract leading global companies such as adidas, DXC, Kohler, TeamViewer and Tezos that want access and exposure to our community of followers and association with our brand.
Our global community of followers engages with us in a variety of ways:
• Premier League games at our home stadium, Old Trafford, played in front of a crowd, have been virtually sold out since the 1997/98 season. In the 2020/21 season, due to COVID-19 and associated government restrictions, 33 of our 34 home games were played behind closed doors. From the start of the 2021/22 season, Old Trafford stadium welcomed back fans at full capacity and all matches in the year operated at full capacity.
• We undertake exhibition games and promotional tours on a global basis, enabling our worldwide followers to see our team play. These games are in addition to our competitive matches and take place during the summer months or during gaps in the football season. Over the last 6 years, we have played 28 exhibition games in Australia, China, Ireland, Norway, Singapore, Thailand, the United States and the United Kingdom. Due to COVID-19 and competition delays resulting in the deferral of a number of 2019/20 Premier League, FA Cup and Europa League matches to July and August 2020, no promotional tour was undertaken in the summer of 2020. During the summer of 2021, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we did not undertake a promotional overseas tour and instead we
28

played four domestic games, two of which were held at Old Trafford. In the summer of 2022, we returned to a more normal pre-season schedule with promotional tours to Australia, Norway and Thailand.
• Our customer relationship management (“CRM”) database, a proprietary data repository that includes contact and transactional details of followers and customers around the globe, enables us to analyze and better understand prospects and customers to drive revenues. As of 30 June 2022, we estimate that the CRM database holds approximately 50.0 million records.
• As of 30 June 2022, we also had more than 220.8 million total social connections. Last year we reported a year-end figure as of 30 June 2021 of 176.1 million total social connections (a 25.4% increase). Total social connections include the following:
• We have a very popular brand page on Facebook with approximately 75 million connections as of 30 June 2022. In comparison, the New York Yankees had just over 9 million connections and the Dallas Cowboys had approximately 8.3 million connections as of 30 June 2022.
• As of 30 June 2022, our Twitter accounts had more than 36.2 million followers, an increase of 23.6% from 30 June 2021.
• We have over 58.8 million followers on Instagram as of 30 June 2022, an increase of 42.7% from 30 June 2021. We continue to be the most-followed Premier League club on Instagram.
• As of 30 June 2022, our YouTube channel had over 6 million subscribers, an increase of 46% from 30 June 2021.
• We have developed a significant presence on TikTok, with our channel reaching 15.8 million followers following its launch in October 2020.
• We also have a significant presence on Chinese social media. Ahead of the 2022/23 season, we launched on Chinese platform Xiaohongshu (also known as RED). We continue to be the mostfollowed football club on Sina Weibo, with over 11 million followers as of 30 June 2022.
• Having launched our new ManUtd.com website in May 2018, which in August that year was followed by the launch of our first free global mobile application, focus has since turned to developing digital media opportunities in a number of key strategic areas.
• Since 2013 we have wholly owned our in-house television network MUTV, ensuring that we have both a greater degree of control over the production, distribution and quality of our proprietary content and better insight into how to evolve our digital media strategy as we continue to develop and roll out carefully targeted new products and services. Distributed globally, MUTV enables our fans to watch our men’s first-team tour matches live, our Academy and selected women’s team matches live, as well as exclusively produced original productions and interviews with players and our team manager and the manager’s weekly press conference. Furthermore, the new app had been enhanced to better integrate our podcast offering to allow fans to listen to our podcasts as they are meant to be consumed.
• In May 2022 we further expanded the reach of our in-house television network by incorporating MUTV into our main global application and removing the need for fans to have multiple iOS or Android apps. At the same time we brought in several new features including messaging, matchday audio streaming and providing access to our Premier League archive collection for the first time. Opening up this archive of Premier League matches has significantly enhanced our digital offering, providing fans with full access to over 1,100 games and 2,100 goals over a thirty-year period.
• We have expanded the reach of MUTV, by launching a direct to consumer (‘D2C’) proposition on iOS, Android, AppleTV, Roku, Amazon Fire and Xbox. Our linear television network continues to be the most subscribed football channel in the United Kingdom.
• During fiscal year 2022, according to Futures Data, our 2021/22 season games generated a cumulative audience reach of 2.9 billion viewers; thus on a per game basis our 49 games attracted an average cumulative audience reach of over 59.8 million viewers.
29

• We have one of the strongest online global brands providing us with significant opportunities to further engage with our followers and develop our media assets and revenue streams.
Our Business Model and Revenue Drivers
We operate and manage our business as a single reporting segment—the operation of professional sports teams. However, we review our revenue through three principal sectors—Commercial, Broadcasting and Matchday.
• Commercial: Within the Commercial revenue sector, we monetize our global brand via two revenue streams: sponsorship and retail, merchandising, apparel & product licensing.
• Sponsorship: We monetize the value of our global brand and community of followers through marketing and sponsorship relationships with leading international and regional companies around the globe. To better leverage the strength of our brand, we have developed a segmentation sponsorship strategy. Our sponsorship revenue was £147.9 million, £140.2 million and £182.7 million, for each of the years ended 30 June 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenue for the years ended 30 June 2022 and 30 June 2021 was affected by the first team’s pre-season tours being impacted by COVID-19 restrictions.
• Retail, Merchandising, Apparel & Product Licensing: We market and sell sports apparel, training and leisure wear and other clothing featuring the Manchester United brand on a global basis. In addition, we also sell other licensed products, from coffee mugs to bed spreads, featuring the Manchester United brand and trademarks. These products are distributed through Manchester United branded retail centers and e-commerce platforms, as well as our partners’ wholesale distribution channels. Our retail, merchandising, apparel & product licensing revenue was £109.9 million, £92.0 million and £96.3 million for each of the years ended 30 June 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenue for the years ended 30 June 2021 and 30 June 2020 was impacted by COVID-19 and the partial closure of the Old Trafford Megastore.
Our Commercial revenue was £257.8 million, £232.2 million and £279.0 million for each of the years ended 30 June 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Our other two revenue sectors, Broadcasting and Matchday, ordinarily provide predictable cash flow and global media exposure that enables us to continue to invest in the success of the teams and expand our brand.
• Broadcasting: We benefit from the distribution of live football content directly from the revenue we receive and indirectly through increased global exposure for our commercial partners. Broadcasting revenue is derived from the global television rights relating to the Premier League, UEFA club competitions and other competitions. In addition, our wholly-owned global television channel, MUTV, delivers Manchester United programming to territories around the world. In addition to our broadcasting channel, we have also launched a MUTV D2C subscription mobile application which is available on iOS, Android, Amazon Fire, Apple TV, Roku and Xbox. Broadcasting revenue including, in some cases, prize money received by us in respect of various competitions, will vary from year to year as a result of variability in the amount of available prize money and the performance of our men’s first team in such competitions. Our Broadcasting revenue was £214.9 million, £254.8 million and £140.2 million for each of the years ended 30 June 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenue for the year ended 30 June 2021 includes the impact of ten matches related to 2019/20 competitions played at the start of fiscal 2021 following the deferral of all competitions as a result of COVID-19.
• Matchday: We believe Old Trafford is one of the world’s iconic sports venues. It seats 74,240, inclusive of accessible platforms accommodating 556 disabled supporters, and is the largest football club stadium in the United Kingdom. We have averaged over 99% of attendance capacity for our Premier League matches played in front of a crowd in each of the last 24 years. Matchday revenue will vary from year to year as a result of the number of home games played and the performance of our men’s first team in various competitions. Our Matchday revenue was £110.5 million, £7.1 million and £89.8 million for each of the years ended 30 June 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. COVID-19
30

had a significant impact on Matchday revenue for the years ended 30 June 2021 and 30 June 2020. During the year ended 30 June 2021, 33 out of 34 home matches were played behind closed doors. During the year ended 30 June 2020, all competitions were suspended in mid-March 2020 and following the resumption of play in June 2020, all matches were played behind closed doors. All matches during the year ended 30 June 2022 operated at full capacity.
Total revenue for the years ended 30 June 2022, 2021 and 2020 was £583.2 million, £494.1 million and £509.0 million, respectively.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe our key competitive strengths are:
• One of the most successful sports teams in the world: Founded in 1878, Manchester United is one of the most successful sports teams in the world—playing one of the world’s most popular spectator sports. We have won 66 trophies in nine different leagues, competitions and cups since 1908. Our ongoing success is supported by our highly developed football infrastructure and global scouting network.
• A globally recognized brand with a large, worldwide following: Our 144-year history, our success and the global popularity of our sport have enabled us to become, we believe, one of the world’s most recognizable brands. We enjoy the support of our worldwide community of 1.1 billion fans and followers. The composition of our follower base is far reaching and diverse, transcending cultures, geographies, languages and socio-demographic groups, and we believe the strength of our brand goes beyond the world of sports.
• Ability to successfully monetize our brand: The popularity and quality of our globally recognized brand make us an attractive marketing partner for companies around the world. Our community of followers is strong in more emerging markets which enables us to deliver media exposure and growth to our partners in these markets.
• Well established marketing infrastructure driving Commercial revenue growth: We have a large global team dedicated to the development and monetization of our brand and to the sourcing of new revenue opportunities. The team has considerable experience and expertise in sponsorship sales, customer relationship management, marketing execution, advertising support and brand development. In addition, we have developed an increasing range of case studies, covering multiple sponsorship categories and geographies, which in combination with our many years’ experience enables us to demonstrate and deliver an effective set of marketing capabilities to our partners on a global and regional basis. Our team is dedicated to the development and monetization of our brand and to the sourcing of new revenue opportunities.
• Sought-after content capitalizing on the proliferation of digital and social media: We produce content that is followed year-round by our global community of fans and followers. Our content distribution channels are international and diverse, and we actively adopt new media channels to enhance the accessibility and reach of our content. We believe our ability to generate proprietary and exclusive content, which we distribute on our own global platforms as well as via popular third-party social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, Sina Weibo and others, constitute an ongoing growth opportunity. We continue to grow our dominant presence on social media. Over the 2021/22 season, we generated over 2.8 billion interactions (an increase of 72% compared to the previous season), gained 42.8 million net new followers (an increase of 24% compared to the previous season) and drew 7.3 billion video views (an increase of 145% compared to previous season). We are the most-followed Premier League club on all major social media platforms. Following the successful D2C launch of MUTV on iOS, Android, and MUTV.com, and building on the global success of its linear distribution, in July 2018 we launched MUTV applications on ‘connected TV’ platforms—namely, AppleTV, Roku, Amazon Fire and Xbox. This gives our fans the ability to watch MUTV without a cable subscription. Existing subscribers to the MUTV mobile application and web platforms can access these new platforms for free via a universal login feature which allows the same credentials to be used across several devices. This continued expansion provides MUTV access to a new demographic of the club’s fan base. Recent figures show that connected TV usage is

highest amongst young Millennials (born 1980—1995) and Generation Z (born after 1995), representing a growing trend of younger audiences accessing programming on over the top (“OTT”) platforms in place of traditional linear television.
• Seasoned management team and committed ownership: Our senior management has considerable experience and expertise in the football, commercial, media and finance industries.
Our Strategy
We aim to increase our revenue and profitability by expanding our high growth businesses that leverage our brand, global community and marketing infrastructure. The key elements of our strategy are:
• Continue to invest in our team, facilities and other brand enhancing initiatives: Dating back to our first league championship in 1908 through present day, where we have earned a record number of English League titles, we have enjoyed a rich tradition of football excellence. We believe our many years of on field success coupled with an iconic stadium and high level of fan engagement has driven our leading global brand. We are well positioned to continue reinvesting our free cash flow in brand enhancing initiatives. Our brand begins with strong on-field performance, and we remain committed to attracting and retaining the highest quality players for our first teams and coaching staff. To maintain our high standard of performance we will continue to invest in our team. We will also continue to invest in our facilities, including the Old Trafford Stadium, to maintain the quality of service, enhance the fan experience and drive their high level of engagement and loyalty. We have undertaken several initiatives at Old Trafford to enhance our Matchday fan experience, revenue and profitability including restructuring the composition of our stadium, with a particular emphasis on developing premium seating and hospitality facilities. Furthermore, we have recently installed barrier seating at Old Trafford to provide a future opportunity for safe standing for fans, subject to potential legislation being passed. Our commitment to the fan experience has resulted in strong fan loyalty with over 99% average attendance for all of our Premier League games played in front of a crowd since the 1997/98 season other than the 2019/20 and 2020/21 seasons which were impacted by COVID-19 and related government regulations. Furthermore, we continue to invest in several other areas including our digital media assets and emerging markets to grow our global fan base and increase our ability to engage with our fans in multiple ways. We remain committed to investing in our team, our facilities and other initiatives to continue our many years of success and enhance our brand globally. We expect these initiatives will continue to be key drivers of our sales, profit and leading brand recognition going forward.
• Expansion and renewal of sponsors: We are well-positioned to continue to secure sponsorships with leading brands and further develop our relationships with existing sponsors. We have historically implemented a proactive approach to identifying, securing and supporting sponsors, including expanding our sponsorship team to bolster our analytical capabilities and effectiveness. We continue to place great emphasis on working with our existing sponsors and maintaining a strong renewals base. During fiscal year 2022, we announced a new training shirt partnership with Tezos, as well as two other new principal partnerships, five new global partnerships and extensions to eight existing partnerships.
• Further develop our retail, merchandising, apparel & product licensing business: Currently, we have a 10-year agreement with adidas with respect to our global technical sponsorship and dual-branded licensing rights, which began on 1 August 2015. The agreement with adidas does not include the rights with respect to mono-branded licensing rights or the right to create and operate Manchester United branded soccer schools, physical retail channels and e-commerce retail channels. In the future, we plan to invest to expand our portfolio of product licensees to enhance the range of product offerings available to our followers. Additionally, we may also seek to refine how we segment the different elements of this business. We may also increase our focus on developing these rights more proactively, alone or with other partners.
Our e-commerce platform, ‘United Direct’ is currently operated under license by Fanatics in close partnership with Manchester United. We believe that the reach and engagement of our Media platform, when combined with our segmented product range, provides the platform for growth in this business.
32

• Exploit digital media opportunities: The rapid shift of media consumption towards digital, mobile and social media platforms presents us with multiple growth opportunities and new revenue streams. Our digital media platforms, applications and social media channels are one of the primary methods by which we engage and transact with our fans around the world. We continue to evolve our media team’s capability to address these opportunities and deliver our strategic objectives.
We maintain a D2C subscription mobile application on iOS, Android, MUTV.com, AppleTV, Roku, Amazon Fire and Xbox which has as of May 2022 been incorporated into our main mobile application. These applications have enabled us to directly access new overseas territories and develop our fan base further domestically
The launch of MUTV D2C gave access to new demographics of the club’s fan base. Recent figures show that connected TV usage is highest amongst young Millennials (born 1985-1995) and Generation Z (born after 1995), representing a growing trend of younger audiences accessing programming on OTT platforms and services in place of traditional linear television.
We publish content on a daily basis on to the club’s website and mobile application. Our website provides commercial benefits for our business with greater e-commerce opportunities and more digital inventory for our commercial partners to benefit from. Our improved media products have driven a significant increase in registrations for our App and Website, up 75% during the 2021/22 season.
In addition, the proliferation of mobile devices has resulted in a need for our content to be consumed ‘on the go’ and in real time. The official mobile application builds upon the aforementioned benefits of the new website and increases the distribution of our content. We constantly iterate and improve the functionality of the club website and club mobile application, using fan insight and data to drive improvements which ultimately enhance our engagement with our fan base. Since launch, we have reached number one in the App Store’s sports category download charts in 106 markets around the world, top 10 within the sports category in 166 markets and currently have active users in over 230 markets globally.
In addition to developing our own digital properties, we intend to leverage third-party media platforms and other social media as a means of further engaging with our fans and creating a source of traffic for our digital media assets. Our digital media offerings are in the early stages of development and present opportunities for future growth.
Further, we continue to monitor the development of emerging technologies and how we can capitalize on these to create engaging fan experiences, which, in turn, can lead to new monetization opportunities. This could be achieved through harnessing the existing expertise of our partners, as has been demonstrated with HCL’s development of our award-winning mobile application and website. Subsequent to the financial year-end, we have partnered with leading IT services company DXC as our new digital transformation partner. Across this multi-year global deal, DXC will use its expertise in digital transformation to improve the way we engage with fans through our digital platforms, including ManUtd.com and the Manchester United App by harnessing the power of data and analytics technologies.
The new partnership with DXC follows the agreement with global technology company TeamViewer to become our new principal shirt partner. Our partnership with TeamViewer provides an opportunity for us to bring our fans even closer to the team they love through groundbreaking AR solutions and remote access to Old Trafford, as well as utilizing their expertise in remote connectivity services.
The club has also signed new partners who offer new fields of expertise as seen by our multi-year training kit partnership with blockchain Tezos and are continuing to develop plans to enter the NFT space. As part of the club’s partnership with Konami, Manchester United also now operates an official esports team, which is featured in global tournaments and provides new content and engagement opportunities for our platforms.

• Enhance the reach and distribution of our broadcasting rights: We are well-positioned to benefit from any increased value and related growth in club distributions associated with the Premier League, the Champions League and other competitions. Season 2022/23 will be the first year of a new threeyear (2022/23−2024/25) Premier League broadcasting rights cycle. All seven live UK packages were sold to the incumbent broadcasters—five to Sky Sports, one to BT Sport and the final one to Amazon Prime Video, which was a new entrant in the previous cycle. The value generated from the sale was consistent with the prior cycle and the terms were agreed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The international broadcasting rights for the new cycle represent a 28% uplift on the previous cycle, with international rights equaling domestic rights for the first time driven primarily by increases in North America and Europe. Overall growth for the new cycle is 16%. The ratio between the maximum and minimum broadcasting revenue that a club can receive from the Premier League in a season is capped at 1.8: 1. The international revenue growth will be allocated to merit payments, as this cap has not yet been reached, and will therefore benefit the higher placed teams.
The UEFA club competition’s three-year media rights agreement which commenced in the 2021/22 season, is worth € 3.5 billion per season, marking an increase of 9% on the previous contract. We believe these contracts underline the continuing demand for, and popularity of, live sports content and football in particular. Unlike other television programming, the unpredictable outcomes of live sports ensures that individuals consume sports programming in real time and in full, resulting in higher audiences and increased interest from television broadcasters and advertisers.
Furthermore, MUTV, our global broadcasting platform, delivers Manchester United programming to territories around the world. We plan to continue to expand the distribution of MUTV supported by improving the quality of its content and its production capabilities.
COVID-19 resulted in the postponement of the 2019/20 Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Europa League competitions with matches suspended from 13 March 2020. This resulted in the deferral of nine remaining Premier League matches, one scheduled Round of 16 Europa League match and the final matches of the FA Cup. The 2019/20 Premier League season resumed on 17 June 2020. The delay to 2019/20 season completion, and broadcast schedule changes to the season as a whole, had implications for the agreements between the Premier League and both UK and international broadcasters, resulting in a rebate due to broadcasters on the annual fees for the 2019/20 Season of £285 million. The mechanism for allocating the impact of the rebate resulted in a reduction of approximately £11 million to amounts we typically would have earned. Half of the cash impact of this rebate has been deducted in the 2021/22 and season and the remaining half will be deducted in 2022/23. UEFA announced in its circular letter 75/2020 that gross revenues from the 2019/20 club competitions were adversely impacted by COVID-19 by a total amount of approximately €566 million, representing 16% of total revenues. This shortfall is being recouped against distributions to clubs who participate in their competitions over the five seasons from 2019/20 through to 2023/24. The reduction for each individual club is calculated in proportion to each individual club’s related revenue and therefore depends upon competition participation and progress. Based upon our performance in the 2021/22 UEFA competitions, we have estimated that our share of the reduction will be approximately €2.2 million compared to the amounts we believe we would have otherwise earned.
• Diversify revenue and improve margins: We aim to increase the revenue and operating margins of our business as we further expand our high growth commercial businesses, including sponsorship, retail, merchandising and licensing.
Our Market Opportunity
We believe that we are one of the world’s most recognizable global brands with a community of 1.1 billion fans and followers. Manchester United is at the forefront of live football, which is a key component of the global sports market.
Other markets driving our business include the global advertising market, the global pay television market and the global apparel market.
34

While our business represents only a small portion of our addressable markets and may not grow at a corresponding rate, we believe our global reach and access to emerging markets position us for continued growth.
Our Men’s Team’s History
Founded in 1878 as Newton Heath L&YR Football Club, our club has operated for over 144 years. The team first entered the English First Division, then the highest league in English football, for the start of the 1892/93 season. Our club name changed to Manchester United Football Club in 1902, and we won the first of our 20 English League titles in 1908. In 1910, we moved to Old Trafford, our current stadium.
In the late 1940s, we returned to on-field success, winning the FA Cup in 1948 and finishing within the top four league positions during each of the first five seasons immediately following the Second World War. During the 1950s, we continued our on-field success under the leadership of manager Sir Matt Busby, who built a popular and famous team based on youth players known as the “Busby Babes.”
In February 1958, an airplane crash resulted in the death of eight of our men’s first team players. Global support and tributes followed this disaster as Busby galvanized the team around such popular players as George Best, Bobby Charlton and Denis Law. Rebuilding of the club culminated with a victory in the 1968 European Cup final, becoming the first English club to win this title.
This storied history preceded the highly successful modern era of Manchester United which began in earnest in 1986 when the club appointed Sir Alex Ferguson as manager, and in 1990 we won the FA Cup and began a long period of sustained success winning the Premier League title a record 13 times. In total, we have won a record 20 English League titles, 12 FA Cups, 5 EFL Cups, 3 European/Champions League Cups, 1 European Europa League Cup, and 1 FIFA Club World Cup, making us one of the most successful clubs in England.
At the end of the 2012/13 season, Sir Alex Ferguson retired as team manager. Sir Alex remains a key member of the club as he is a director of Manchester United Football Club Limited.
Our current team manager, Erik ten Hag, began his role on 23 May 2022 and was appointed on a threeyear contract with an option to extend for a further year. Erik ten Hag previously managed Ajax where he won the Eredivisie on three occasions, the KNVB Cup twice and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League in 2018/19.
Since the inception of the Premier League in 1992, our club has enjoyed consistent success and growth with popular players such as Bryan Robson, Ryan Giggs, Eric Cantona, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Wayne Rooney, Marcus Rashford, David de Gea and Cristiano Ronaldo. The popularity of these players, our distinguished tradition and history, and the on-field success of our men’s first team have allowed us to expand the club into a global brand with an international follower base.
Our Old Trafford stadium, commonly known as “The Theatre of Dreams,” was originally opened on 19 February 1910 with a capacity of approximately 80,000. During the Second World War, Old Trafford was used by the military as a depot, and on 11 March 1941 was heavily damaged by a German bombing raid. The stadium was rebuilt following the war and re-opened on 24 August 1949. The addition of floodlighting, permitting evening matches, was completed in 1957 and a project to cover the stands with roofs was completed in 1959. After a series of additions during the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, capacity at Old Trafford reached 56,385 in 1985. The conversion of the stadium to an all-seater reduced capacity to approximately 44,000 by 1992, the lowest in its history. Thereafter, we began to expand capacity throughout the stadium, bringing capacity to approximately 58,000 by 1996, approximately 68,000 by 2000, and over 74,000 in 2006. Currently, Old Trafford seats 74,240 supporters.

Industry Overview
Football is one of the most popular spectator sports on Earth and global follower interest has enabled the sport to commercialize its activities through sponsorship, retail, merchandising, apparel & product licensing, broadcasting, and Matchday. As a consequence, football constitutes a significant portion of the overall global sports industry, according to AT Kearney.
Football’s growth and increasing popularity is primarily a product of consumer demand for and interest in live sports, whether viewed in person at the venue or through television and digital media. The sport’s revenue growth has been driven by the appetite among consumers, advertisers and media distributors for access to and association with these live sports events, in particular those featuring globally recognized teams.
The major football leagues and clubs in England, Germany, Spain, Italy and France have established themselves as the leading global entities due to their history as well as their highly developed television and advertising markets, according to AT Kearney. The combination of historical success and media development in the core European markets has helped to drive revenue, which in turn enables those leagues to attract the best players in the world, further strengthening their appeal to followers.
As television and digital media such as broadband internet and mobile extend their reach globally, the availability of and access to live games and other content of the leading European leagues has increased and live games are now viewed worldwide. In addition, advances in new technology continue to both improve the television and digital media user experience and the effectiveness of sponsorships and advertising on these platforms. These trends further strengthen the commercial benefit of associating with football for media distributors and advertisers and increase the global opportunities for the sport.
League Structure
Manchester United is a member of the English Premier League, the top league in the United Kingdom, which has been, for a long time, and continues to be, one of the elite leagues in the world.

36

The Premier League is a private company wholly-owned by its 20 member clubs, with responsibility for the competition, its Rule Book, the centralized broadcasting rights and other commercial rights. The Premier League works proactively with the member clubs and other football authorities domestically and internationally including the Football Association, UEFA and FIFA. Each member club is an independent shareholder of the Premier League and works within the rules of football defined by the various governing bodies.
Governing Bodies
Manchester United operates under three different levels of governing bodies, ranging from worldwide to continental to national jurisdiction.
FIFA is the international governing body of football around the world. Headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, FIFA is responsible for the regulation, promotion and development of football worldwide. All football played at any level must abide by the Laws of the Game, as set forth by FIFA. FIFA’s rules and regulations are decided by the International Football Association Board (“IFAB”) and reviewed on an annual basis. FIFA also sets the international fixture calendar which, along with European and domestic cup dates, takes precedence over the domestic football league.
UEFA is a competition organizer and is responsible for the organization and regulation of crossborder football in Europe. UEFA is primarily known for its European club competitions, the Champions League, the Europa League, and the Europa Conference League. Currently the Premier League gets four teams into the Champions League, two into the Europa League and one into the Europa Conference League. The representative structures for UEFA are primarily national association-based with the FA representing English football on numerous committees.
The FA is the national governing body for football in England and is responsible for sanctioning competition Rule Books, including the Premier League’s, and regulating on-field matters. The FA also organizes the FA Cup competition, in which the 20 Premier League member clubs participate. The FA is a special shareholder of the Premier League that has the ability to exercise a vote on certain specific issues, but has no role in the day-to-day running of the league. Each year the Premier League submits its rules to the FA for approval and sanction. For the Premier League, the FA ensures that throughout the season the Laws of the Game are applied on the field by officials, clubs and players including on- and off-field discipline. The FA is also involved in refereeing, youth development and the United Kingdom’s largest sports charity, the Football Foundation.
Our Football Operations
Our football operations are primarily comprised of the following activities: our men’s first team, our youth academy, our global scouting networks, our women’s team and other operations such as our sport science, medical and fitness operations at Carrington.
Men’s first team
Our men’s first team plays professional football in the Premier League, domestic cup competitions in England including the FA Cup and EFL Cup and, subject to qualifying, international cup competitions, including the Champions League.
Our men’s first team is led by our manager Erik ten Hag, supported by his Assistant Coaches Mitchell Van der Gaag and Steve McClaren and Football Director John Murtough. They are all supported by a team of over 225 individuals, including coaches and scouts for our men’s first team and youth academy, medical and physiotherapy staff, sports science and performance and match analysis staff.
We have 69 players under contract of whom 41 have made an appearance for our men’s first team. The remaining players may play for the youth academy teams but are being developed such that they may make it to a starting position on our men’s first team or the first team of other clubs. This structure has been put in place with the aim of developing some of the world’s best football players and maximizing our men’s first team’s chances of winning games, leagues and tournaments.
37

Domestic transfers of players between football clubs are governed by the Premier League Rules and the FA Rules, which allow a professional player to enter into a contract with and be registered to play for any club, and to receive a signing-on fee in connection with such contract. Players are permitted to move to another club during the term of their contract if both clubs agree on such transfer. In such circumstances a compensation fee may be payable by the transferee club. FIFA Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (the “FIFA Regulations”) govern international transfers of players between clubs and may require the transferee club to distribute 5% of any compensation fee to the clubs that trained the relevant player. In addition, a 4% levy on any such compensation fee would also be payable to the Premier League. The transferor club in an international transfer may also be entitled to receive payment of “training compensation” under the FIFA Regulations when certain conditions are met. If an out-of-contract player (i.e. a player whose contract with a club has expired or has been terminated) wishes to play for another club, the player’s former club will be entitled to a compensation fee if certain conditions are satisfied. For a domestic transfer, these include conditions regarding the player’s age and requiring the former club to offer the player a new contract on terms which are no less favorable than his current contract. For an international transfer, these include conditions regarding the player’s age only. Subject to limited exceptions, transfers of professional players may only take place during one of the “transfer windows,” which for the Premier League is ordinarily a mid-season winter transfer window during the month of January, and a post-season summer transfer window spanning a maximum of twelve weeks throughout June and August. The summer 2022 transfer window began on 10 June 2022 and ran through until 1 September 2022.
Our players enter into contracts with us that follow a prescribed model based on FA and Premier League rules. Players on our men’s first team typically also enter into an image rights agreement with us, which grants us enhanced rights and protections with respect to use of their image. Our men’s first team players generally enter into contracts of between two and five years’ duration.

Women’s team
The club launched its first professional women’s team in the 2018/19 season, winning the FA Women’s Championship in their first season thereby securing promotion to the FA Women’s Super League (the top tier in England). The team has finished in 4th position in both the 2020/21 and 2021/22 seasons, establishing itself as one of the leading clubs in the English game. Currently led by Head Coach Marc Skinner, our aims are to contribute to the growth of the women’s game, to develop a team capable of competing at the highest level in the women’s game both domestically and in Europe which has a core consisting of players who have graduated from our long-established and highly successful Manchester United Girls’ Regional Talent Club, and to offer academy players a clear route to top level football within the club. Three members of our Women’s team were part of the England Women’s squad that won the European Championships in July 2022 and a fourth joined the club after the tournament.
Youth academy
The aim of our youth academy is to create a flow of talent from the youth teams up to our men’s first team and we are proud to have included a home grown player in every matchday squad for the last eightyfive years. Developing academy players is embedded as part of the history and culture of our club, and also means that we can avoid the expense of purchasing players in those positions from the transfer market. As part of their development plan for reaching our first team, our academy players may be loaned to other clubs such that they gain first team experience elsewhere. This also enables these players to enhance their standing and value within the game, and those who do not make it into our men’s first team frequently achieve places at other professional football clubs, often generating income for the club through transfer fees as a result.
Our youth academy program consists of 10 junior teams ranging from under 9s to under 23s. Each team consists of 15 to 30 players, each of whom takes part in an age specific elite player development and games program during the season. In May 2022, our Under 18 men’s team won a record 11th FA Youth Cup, with the final played at Old Trafford Stadium in front of over 67,000 fans.
Scouting network
Together with our youth academy, our scouting system is another source of our football talent. Through our scouting system, we recruit players for both our men’s first team and youth academy. Our scouting system consists of a professional network of staff who scout in general and for specific positions and age groups.
As well as being an established domestic network that allows us to identify and attract the best talent within Manchester and England, we have over the past 5 years enhanced our scouting infrastructure, so that we now have a presence in all major footballing nations. We believe this will enhance our ability to identify and recruit the best players for our academy and first team for many years to come.
Training facilities
We have invested significant resources into developing a performance center which contains advanced sports and science equipment. We have highly experienced training staff working at the performance center, where we provide physiotherapy, bio-mechanical analysis and nutritional guidance to our players as part of our drive to ensure that each player is able to achieve peak physical condition. We believe the quality of our performance center differentiates our club from many of our competitors.
Revenue Sectors
Commercial
Within the Commercial revenue sector, we monetize our brand via two revenue streams: sponsorship; and retail, merchandising, apparel & product licensing. The primary source of revenue in this sector comes from sponsorship, which allows highly diverse and global companies to partner with Manchester United, regionally or internationally, in order to realize sponsorship benefits and associate themselves with our brand.

Sponsorship Our sponsorship agreements are negotiated directly by our commercial team. Our sponsors are granted
various rights, which can include: • rights in respect of our brand, logo and other intellectual property; • rights in respect of our player and manager imagery; • exposure on our television platform, MUTV; • exposure on our website and mobile application; • exposure on our club branded social media channels; • exposure on digital perimeter advertising boards at Old Trafford; • exposure on interview backdrops; and • the right to administer promotions targeted at customers whose details are stored on our CRM database. Any use of our intellectual property rights by sponsors is under license. However, we retain the
ownership rights to our intellectual property.
Sponsorship development and strategy We pursue our sponsorship deals through a developed infrastructure for commercial activities. We have
a dedicated sales team that focuses on developing commercial opportunities and sourcing new sponsors. We target potential sponsors that we believe will benefit from association with our brand and have the necessary financial resources to support an integrated marketing relationship. By cultivating strong relationships with our sponsors, we generate significant revenue and leverage our sponsors’ co-branded marketing strategies to further grow our brand. We are successful in executing a geographic and product categorized approach to selling our sponsorship rights.
We offer category exclusivity on a global basis to companies within particular industries, such as beverage, logistics and hotels. We also offer sponsorship exclusivity within a particular geography for certain industries, such as travel.
In seeking any individual partnership, we aim to establish an indicative value for that sponsorship based on the prospective sponsor’s industry and marketing objectives. We will only pursue a sponsorship if we believe it reflects the value that we deliver. Our current strategy is to focus more closely on larger, established global brands rather than regional partnerships.
We believe that certain key sectors play an active role in sports sponsorship. We have sponsors in a number of these sectors and we believe that there is significant potential to expand this platform by selectively targeting companies within the remaining sectors and by growing revenue in existing sectors through additional sponsorship arrangements. High growth markets such as Asia, which we expect to be a key focus for many of our prospective sponsors, are an important element of our sponsorship efforts.

Global, regional and supplier sponsors
In addition to revenue from our shirt sponsor, training kit and training facilities partner, we generated a further £93.4 million in the year ended 30 June 2022 from other global, regional and other sponsors. The

42

length of these sponsorship deals is generally between two and five years. The majority of these sponsorship deals have minimum revenue guarantees and some have additional revenue sharing arrangements.
Global sponsors are granted certain marketing and promotional rights with respect to our brand and intellectual property as well as exposure on our media, such as digital perimeter boards at Old Trafford, MUTV and our website. These rights are granted on a global basis and are exclusive by category. Regional sponsors are granted certain marketing and promotional rights and media exposure, however, these rights are granted for a limited number of territories. Regional sponsors are able to use the rights in their designated territory on an exclusive basis, however they are not granted global category exclusivity.
Financial services affinity sponsorship
There is a significant growth opportunity to further develop Manchester United branded financial services products. These financial services products include credit cards and debit cards, which we believe represent key commercial opportunities within the financial services sector, and also serve as a means of follower expression and loyalty. Depending on the product category, we may pursue affinity agreements on a territory specific or regional basis. Examples of our financial services affinity sponsors include Co-operative Bank (Myanmar), Emirates NBD Bank (UAE), Eurobank (Serbia), Guild Technology Inc. (US), ICICI (India), Lay Buy Holdings (UK), Maybank Group (Malaysia) and National Bank of Egypt (Egypt).
Exhibition games and promotional tours
We conduct exhibition games and promotional tours on a global basis. Our promotional tours enable us to engage with our followers, support the marketing objectives of our sponsors and extend the reach of our brand in strategic markets. The tour matches are broadcast and/or streamed live to subscribers of MUTV. These promotional tours are in addition to our competitive matches and take place during the summer months or during gaps in the football season. Over the last 6 years, we played 28 exhibition games in Australia, China, Ireland, Norway, Singapore, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States.
We normally receive a guaranteed fee for such tours. We also generate revenue from tour sponsorship opportunities sold to existing and new partners. After two consecutive years of no promotional tours as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we returned to overseas pre-season touring with matches played in Thailand, Australia and Norway in July 2022.
Commercial income from the Premier League
In addition to revenue from contracts that we negotiate ourselves, we receive revenue from commercial arrangements negotiated collectively by the Premier League on behalf of its member teams. Income from these commercial contracts negotiated by the Premier League is shared equally between the clubs that are to be in the Premier League for the season to which the income relates. Our pro rata income received from the other commercial contracts negotiated by the Premier League is not material to the Company’s results of operations.
Retail, Merchandising, Apparel & Product Licensing
Unlike American teams in the NFL, MLB and NHL, Manchester United retains full control of the use and monetization of its intellectual property rights worldwide in the areas of retail, merchandising, apparel & product licensing.
Our retail, merchandising, apparel & product licensing business includes the sale of sports apparel, training and leisure wear and other clothing featuring Manchester United brands as well as other licensed products from high fashion and luxury watches to children’s toys and household items such as mugs and bedspreads. These products are distributed on a global basis through Manchester United branded retail stores and e-commerce platform, as well as through our partners’ wholesale distribution channels.
We have a 10-year agreement with adidas with respect to our global technical sponsorship and dualbranded licensing rights, which began on 1 August 2015. The minimum guarantee payable by adidas over the term of the agreement is equal to £750 million, subject to certain adjustments. Payments due in a particular year may increase if our men’s first team wins the Premier League, FA Cup or Champions League, or
43

decrease if our men’s first team fails to participate in the Champions League for two or more consecutive seasons, with the maximum possible increase being £4 million per year and the maximum possible reduction being 30% of the applicable payment for the year in which the second or other consecutive season of nonparticipation falls. If the men’s first team fails to participate in the Champions League for two or more consecutive seasons, then the reduction is applied as from the year in which the second consecutive season of non-participation falls. In the event of a reduction in any year due to the failure to participate in the Champions League for two or more consecutive seasons, the remaining payments revert back to the original terms upon the men’s first team participating again in the Champions League. Any increase or decrease in a particular year would have the effect of increasing or decreasing the minimum guarantee amount of £750 million payable over the 10-year term of the agreement.
The minimum guarantee from adidas does not include mono-branded licensing rights or the right to create and operate Manchester United branded soccer schools, physical retail channels and e-commerce retail channels, which rights may generate additional revenue for the club. We may also benefit from additional royalty payments upon exceeding a threshold of sales.
The agreement with adidas is subject to reciprocal termination provisions in respect of material breach and insolvency. Adidas may reduce the applicable payments for a year by 50% if the men’s first team is not participating in the English Premier League during that year. In addition, adidas may terminate the agreement by giving one full-season’s notice if the men’s first team is relegated from the English Premier League or if it is otherwise determined that the men’s first team shall not be participating in the Premier League or the top English league.
The Manchester United match jerseys and training wear collections are completely redesigned for each season by adidas. The annual launch of the new jerseys is always a much-anticipated day for our global community of followers. The result is a robust adidas collection apparel business.
In addition to our adidas collection, we have a number of premium brands utilizing Manchester United intellectual property for the creation of dual-branded merchandise, where we receive a royalty payment and a sponsorship fee from the partner.
Retail
We operate our flagship retail store at the Old Trafford stadium, which ordinarily trades year-round, and not just on Matchdays. In addition to the Old Trafford store, we have a Manchester United branded retail location in Macau (which is operated under franchise by a third-party licensee).
Merchandising & product licensing
We grant product licenses across a wide range of Manchester United products which are highly sought after by our followers around the world. Under our product licensing agreements, we receive royalties from the sales of specific Manchester United branded products. Under some product licensing agreements, we receive a minimum guaranteed payment from the licensee. The majority of licenses are granted on a non-exclusive rights basis for specific product categories, within a specific country or geographic region.
E-commerce
We currently have arrangements in place whereby Fanatics has been granted separate licenses to use our brand and/or trademarks to operate the official online store, branded as “United Direct”, in the United States and the rest of the world. The online store sells a range of Manchester United branded merchandise including official replica kit and other clothing from adidas. In addition, the online store offers a broad range of other apparel, equipment such as balls, luggage and other accessories, homewares such as bedroom, kitchen and bathroom accessories, and collectibles, souvenirs and other gifts. We currently receive a percentage of net sales from the online store as a royalty payment.
We believe there is a significant opportunity for us to expand our e-commerce capabilities through improved leverage of our digital media platform, and focusing on delivering a tailored digital shopping experience at a regional level. Specifically, we intend to improve our ability to offer targeted merchandise to our followers, complemented by more efficient fulfillment mechanics, including product delivery,
44

availability and payment methods. Our e-commerce business saw continued growth in fiscal year 2022 as we continue to invest and focus in the distribution channel.
Broadcasting
Central Media
We benefit from the distribution and broadcasting of live football content directly from the revenue we receive and indirectly through increased global exposure for our commercial partners. Broadcasting revenue is derived from the centrally negotiated domestic and international television and radio rights to the Premier League, the Champions League and other competitions. In addition, our wholly owned global television channel, MUTV, delivers Manchester United programming to territories around the world.
The Premier League and UEFA negotiate their own media rights contracts independently of the participating clubs. In respect of the Premier League, media agreements are typically three years in duration (although some longer deals have been agreed in certain overseas territories) and are centrally negotiated and entered into with media distributors by the Premier League on behalf of the member clubs. Under the agreements, Broadcasting revenue for each season is typically shared between the clubs that are to be in the Premier League for that season and a part-share for the clubs that were relegated from the Premier League in the previous four seasons. After certain deductions approved by the Premier League (for example, donations to “grass roots” football development and other causes), the income from the sale of the domestic broadcasting rights is allocated to the current and relegated clubs according to a formula based on, among other things, finishing position in the league and the number of live television appearances. Under the upcoming Premier League broadcasting cycle which commences in the 2022/23 season, international broadcasting rights are fixed at the previous cycle’s equal share adjusted for inflation. The increase in rights values above this are allocated to the twenty Premier League clubs based upon finishing position in the league.
COVID-19 resulted in the postponement of the 2019/20 Premier League, UEFA competitions and FA Cup competition with matches suspended from 13 March 2020. This resulted in the deferral of nine remaining Premier League matches, one scheduled Round of 16 Europa League match and the final matches of the FA Cup. The 2019/20 Premier League season resumed on 17 June 2020. The delay to 2019/20 season completion, and broadcast schedule changes to the season as a whole, had implications for the agreements between the Premier League and both UK and international broadcasters, resulting in a rebate due to broadcasters on the annual fees for the 2019/20 Season of £285 million. The mechanism for allocating the impact of the rebate on individual clubs was approved by the 20 Premier League clubs and resulted in a reduction of approximately £11 million to amounts we typically would have earned. Half of the cash impact of this rebate has been deducted from distributions to clubs in the 2021/22 season and the remaining half will be deducted in 2022/23.
In the Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League, media agreements are also typically three years in duration and are collectively negotiated and entered into by UEFA on behalf of the participating clubs. Each club receives a fixed amount for qualifying for the group stage plus bonuses based on performance. Further fixed amounts are received for participation in the knock-out rounds; knockout play off (Europa League and Europa Conference League only), round of 16, quarter-final, and semi-final. The runner-up and winner of the competition also earn additional amounts.

For the current 3-year agreement (which commenced in the 2021/22 season) amounts are distributed to each club as follows:

(1) In the event of a draw, the non-distributed balance will be aggregated and split among the clubs that won matches at the group stage in proportion to the number of matches won.
In August of each season, the previous season’s Champions League winner and Europa League winner will play in the UEFA Super Cup where each team can expect to receive a further €3.5 million participation fee, with the winner receiving an additional €1.0 million.
Total fixed distribution amounts are €1.101 billion (previous cycle: €1.073 billion) for Champions League, €255.8 million (previous cycle: €308 million) for Europa League and €188 million for the Europa Conference League. In addition to the fixed amounts, UEFA allocates monies to a market pool which is also distributed to clubs who reach the group-stage and beyond. Further, with effect from the three-year cycle 2018/19 to 2020/21, UEFA introduced the coefficient ranking. The total market pool for the Champions League is €300.3 million per annum (previous cycle: €292 million per annum) and the total coefficient ranking allocation is €600.6 million per annum (previous cycle: €585 million per annum) giving a combined annual total of €900.9 million (previous cycle: €877 million per annum). The total market pool for the Europa League is €139.5 million per annum (previous cycle: €168 million per annum) and the total coefficient ranking allocation is €69.8 million per annum (previous cycle: €84 million per annum) giving a combined annual total of €209.3 million (previous cycle: €252 million per annum). As a reminder, the Europa League has reduced from 48 teams to 32 teams in the previous cycle. The total market pool for the new Europa Conference League is €23.5 million per annum and the total coefficient ranking allocation is €23.5 million per annum giving a combined annual total of €47 million.
The individual club coefficient is determined by reference to past performance in UEFA club competitions over a ten-year period with additional points for historical winners of UEFA club competitions. On the basis of these parameters, a ranking has been established. The total Champions League amount of €600.6 million is divided into ‘coefficient shares’, with each share worth €1.137 million. The lowest-ranked team will receive one share (€1.1378 million). One share will be added to every rank and so the highestranked team will receive 32 shares (€36.38 million). The total Europa League amount of €69.8 million is divided into ‘coefficient shares’, with each share worth €132,000. The lowest-ranked team will receive one share (€132,000). One share will be added to every rank and so the highest-ranked team will receive 32 shares (€4.22 million). The total Europa Conference League amount of €23.5 million is divided into ‘coefficient shares’, with each share worth €44,500. The lowest-ranked team will receive one share (€44,500). One share will be added to every rank and so the highest-ranked team will receive 32 shares (€1.42 million).
46

The market pool for each country is calculated based on the proportional value of its broadcasting agreements with UEFA relative to the total value of broadcasting agreements from all countries represented at the group stage. The total English market pool for the 2021/22 Champions League competition was approximately €60 million. This amount can vary from season to season subject to the composition of the clubs taking part in the group stage. 50% of each country market pool is distributed to its group-stage representatives based on each club’s domestic performance in the previous season. For the Champions League this is based on league finishing position. For the Europa League this is based on league finishing position and potentially both domestic cup competitions (the winners of the FA Cup, if participating in the Europa League, earn the highest share). Any club which qualifies for the Champions League group-stage by virtue of winning the Europa League in the previous season does not receive a distribution of the 50% market pool based on domestic performance in the previous season. England has one spot in the Europa Conference League, against which 100% of fixed marker pool monies are allocated.
The remaining 50% of the market pool is distributed as follows:
• for the Champions League, based on the number of games played in the current competition relative to teams from the same country.
• for the Europa League, split across each round of the competition (40% to the group stage, 15% to the round of 32, 20% to the round of 16, 13% to the quarter-finals, 8% to the semi-finals and 4% to the final) which is distributed to teams who participate in the relevant round based on the proportional value of the country broadcasting rights relative to the value of all broadcasting agreements for countries represented at each stage.
• for the Europa Conference League, split across each round of the competition (40% to the group stage, 15% to the round of 32, 20% to the round of 16, 13% to the quarter-finals, 8% to the semifinals and 4% to the final) which is distributed to teams who participate in the relevant round based on the proportional value of the country broadcasting rights relative to the value of all broadcasting agreements for countries represented at each stage.
Broadcasting revenue including, in some cases, prize money received by us in respect of various competitions, will vary from year to year as a result of variability in the amount of available prize money and the performance of our men’s first team in such competitions.
UEFA announced in its circular letter 75/2020 that gross revenues from the 2019/20 club competitions were adversely impacted by COVID-19 by a total amount of approximately €566 million, representing 16% of total revenues. This shortfall is being recouped against distributions to clubs who participate in their competitions over the five seasons from 2019/20 through to 2023/24. As a result, going forward through to season 2023/24, we expect approximately a 3.5% annual reduction to the above distributions. The reduction for each individual club is calculated in proportion to each individual club’s related revenue and is therefore dependent upon competition participation and progress.
Digital media
Our website,ManUtd.com, is published in seven languages and is available globally. We use our website, which incorporates e-commerce services and venue microsites (United Events, Exec Club, Foundation, Matchday VIP), to communicate with our followers, promote the Manchester United brand and provide a platform for our sponsors to reach a global audience. Our website is designed with a mobile first approach, with content including exclusive articles, exclusive videos, real-time match updates, live blogging capabilities, social integration and sharing capabilities, improved search and discoverability, content recommendations, fan polls, voting trivia and statistics.
The proliferation of digital television, broadband and fibre internet, smartphones, mobile applications and social media globally provides our business with many opportunities to extend the reach of our content. Specifically, we intend to use our digital media platforms to generate value through extended sponsor positioning, driving e-commerce, and direct-to-consumer opportunities, including selling premium services such as video and exclusive content subscriptions. We will also continue to leverage our digital media platform to generate customer data and information as well as follower profiles of commercial value to us, our sponsors and our media partners. We believe that in the future, digital media will be one of the primary
47

means through which we engage and interact with our follower base. Recent measures to improve the fan digital experience include: single sign-on (SSO), requiring only one user ID per fan to access all club platforms; and digital ticketing, improving security and reducing our environment footprint.
Content and localization
Our digital media properties are an increasingly important means through which we engage with our fan base, domestically and internationally. To take advantage of that opportunity, we are constantly developing our premium, localized and exclusive content to enhance the proposition for our followers, members and paid subscribers around the world.
Our followers generally prefer to consume our content in their language and context. We believe we can effectively deliver tailored services to our followers globally through various language offerings, geographic targeting and personalized content. Our mobile application is available in Simplified Chinese. We also currently have international language websites in English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Simplified Chinese, Korean and Japanese. On our social channels we have international language feeds in English, Spanish, Arabic, Simplified Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Malay and Thai. This enables us to engage with our followers in their native language and to produce content that is specific to each region. This focus on true localization, not translation, can be seen across all our social media platforms. For example, on TikTok we use local trends, hashtags and culturally relevant music to speak to fans in a truly global, local way.
Mobile services and applications
There has been a significant increase in the prevalence of broadband and video-enabled mobile devices in recent years. Mobile devices running the iOS or Android operating system enable consumers to browse websites, watch video, share content, access dedicated applications and conduct e-commerce. As a consequence, we are seeing the majority of our followers now accessing our website and digital content via their mobile devices.
At the start of the 2018/19 season we launched our first free global mobile application. This application has been developed in conjunction with our website to provide benefits to our fans, through a clean and easy navigation interface. We believe our mobile application also provides significant benefits to our business through better e-commerce functionality and more digital inventory for our commercial partners to benefit from. During the 2021/22 season further enhancements were made to our mobile application to incorporate our direct-to-consumer MUTV offering and provide additional functionality including messaging, matchday audio streaming and providing access to our Premier League archive collection for the first time. These additional features have been successful in driving additional data acquisition and have further enhanced our personalization capabilities within the mobile application. We believe our focus on our owned and operated products will lead to an improved customer experience via the mining of owned data, which will lead to more personalization and a more engaged fan base, as users spend more time on our platforms and return regularly.
We launched a free content section allowing all fans access to our exclusive programming, with subscribers then having access to our full range of programming, including both on demand and linear experiences around full match commentary for all Premier League, Champions League and domestic cup matches, as well as live tour matches and coverage. Subscribers can also view pre- and post-match analysis for all matches by club legends, exclusive interviews with the team manager and men’s first-team players, awardwinning documentaries, celebrity features, and live broadcasts of Academy team matches and more recently women’s team matches.
We intend to continue developing the functionality of our mobile applications to facilitate greater engagement and to satisfy global demand.
Video on demand
The proliferation of broadband internet and mobile access also allows us to offer video on demand to our followers around the world. Through our new website, official club mobile application and the MUTV D2C applications, we provide live video and video on demand to our followers in a variety of formats and
48

commercial models. Some video on-demand content is free to all users, some content is only accessible upon registration and some content, as in the case of live pre-season tour matches, is available on a subscription basis.
Depending on the market, going forward we may offer video on demand services via our media partners as part of a comprehensive suite of content rights, as well as on a direct-to-consumer basis.
Social media
With a global fan base, we believe there is a significant opportunity to leverage the capabilities of social media platforms to augment our relationships with our followers around the world. By establishing an official presence on these platforms, we believe we will be able to deepen the connections with our follower base and improve our ability to market and sell products and services to our followers.
As of 30 June 2022 we had over 220.8 million social connections including approximately 75 million connections on our Facebook page, over 58.8 million followers on Instagram and over 36.2 million followers to our Twitter accounts. For the 2021/22 season we generated over 2.8 billion interactions across all platforms.
We use our social footprint as a means to communicate news and other club updates, engage with our followers, identify active followers, solicit feedback from our users, tailor future digital media offerings and enhance the overall follower experience.
We intend to continue to expand our reach through new and different social media and mobile chat platforms by launching additional Manchester United branded presences on global platforms as well as regional and language-specific platforms.
We believe this continuous expansion will enable us to broaden the reach of our brand and the content we produce, enhance our engagement with followers in many of our key international and emerging markets as well as opening up a new demographic of fans.
While there is no guarantee that our social connections will continue to grow at comparable rates in the future, we believe the combination of platforms on which we have an official presence will provide an increasing source of traffic to our club branded digital media services and e-commerce properties, enhance our ability to convert users into customers through video and exclusive content subscriptions and e-commerce, and continue to provide extensive positioning opportunities for our partners.
Customer relationship management
One of our ongoing strategic objectives is to further develop our understanding of and deepen the relationships with our fans and followers. We operate a CRM database in order to better understand the size, location, demographics and characteristics of our fan and follower base on an aggregated basis. We believe our CRM database enables us to more effectively deliver targeted communications to our fan base which ultimately leads to upsell opportunities through our product and service offerings such as digital subscription services, merchandise and tickets. A deep understanding of our follower base is also valuable to sponsors and media partners who seek to access specific customer categories with targeted and relevant advertising.
MUTV
MUTV is our wholly owned global television channel and is broadcast in numerous countries. MUTV broadcasts a wide variety of content which is compelling to our global community of followers, including live first team football from our pre-season tours, academy and women’s team live football, club news, game highlights, and exclusive “behind the scenes” coverage of our club.
Depending on the market, we may offer MUTV as a single product to television distributors for distribution to our fans on a linear television basis or directly to our fans on a D2C basis which allows them to subscribe directly to the club via our OTT offering. MUTV is currently available in 230 markets globally. (Markets are defined to reflect regional mobile application availability).
49

For example, in our domestic territory, the United Kingdom, MUTV is offered to consumers through the Sky and Virgin Media distribution platforms and on a D2C basis via a subscription on MUTV mobile applications on iOS and GooglePlay App stores and ‘Connected TV’ applications on platforms such as Roku, Amazon Fire, AppleTV and Xbox. In addition, MUTV is available on MUTV.com.
Outside the United Kingdom, we offer MUTV through distribution partners as part of a suite of media rights, which can be purchased on a bundled or selective basis, and can include certain promotional rights, and via the OTT offerings (both on mobile application and Connected TVs).
MUTV features a range of content, the primary categories of which are:
• highlights from games and other time-delayed game footage (including full matches), both of which are subject to certain holdback periods under the agreements between media distributors, the participating clubs and the Premier League and UEFA;
• live coverage of promotional tours and exhibition games;
• lifestyle programming and other “behind the scenes” content profiling the club, our history, our manager and our players;
• live coverage of women’s team games;
• live coverage of academy and youth games;
• live ‘Managers Press Conference’ before relevant men’s first team fixtures; and
• various other award winning shows and documentaries.
Matchday
Our stadium, which we fully own, is called Old Trafford and is known as “The Theatre of Dreams.” We believe Old Trafford is one of the most famous and historic stadiums in the world. Football followers travel from all over the world to attend a match at Old Trafford, which is the largest football club stadium in the United Kingdom, with a capacity of 74,240. During fiscal 2021, due to COVID-19 and associated government restrictions, 33 of our 34 home games were played behind closed doors. In line with government guidelines, and with a variety of safety measures and protocols in place, including reduced fan capacity, Old Trafford Stadium welcomed back 10,000 supporters for the final home match of the season. The 2021/22 season was played at full stadium capacity throughout. The stadium has approximately 8,000 executive club seats, including 133 luxury boxes, 24 restaurants and 4 sports bars.
We have one of the highest capacity utilizations among English clubs, with an average attendance for our home Premier League matches played in front of a crowd of over 99% for each season since the 1997/98 season. The substantial majority of our tickets are sold to both general admission and executive season ticket holders, the majority of whom pay for all their tickets in advance of the first game of the season.
Other Matchday revenue includes Matchday catering (including the sale of hospitality packages, food and drink), event parking, program sales as well as membership and travel, Manchester United Museum revenue and a share of the ticket revenue from away matches in domestic cup competitions. Matchday revenue also includes revenue from other events hosted at Old Trafford, including other sporting events (including the annual Rugby Super League Grand Final), music concerts and entertainment events.
We operate a membership program for our supporters. Individuals who become official members have the opportunity to apply for tickets to all home matches. Adult Official Members pay £20 per season to join our Lite Membership, £35 to join the Full Membership or £60 to join the Premium membership scheme. At the end of the 2021/22 season we had over 276,000 members, an increase of 95.7% year on year, although the prior year was affected by COVID-19 as all but one game were played behind closed doors.
The Manchester United Museum is located within Old Trafford. It chronicles Manchester United’s 144-year history and houses the club’s most precious artifacts and trophies.
We have frozen general admission season ticket prices for an eleventh consecutive season ahead of the 2022/23 season to support fans in attending our games. We aim to maximize ticket revenue by enhancing
50

the mix of experiences available at each game and by providing a range of options from general admission tickets to multi-seat facilities and hospitality suites. In particular, we have recently increased overall Matchday revenue by restructuring the composition of our stadium, with an emphasis on developing hospitality facilities which sell at a higher price and improve our margins. As part of this effort, we have invested in new and refurbished multi-seat hospitality suites as well as improvements to our single-seat facilities. We expect our enhancements to our hospitality facilities to continue to be a key driver of our profit from Matchday sales going forward.
UEFA Club Licensing and Financial Sustainability Regulations
UEFA oversees the Club Licensing and Financial Sustainability (formerly Financial Fair Play) regulations, which are intended to ensure the financial self-sufficiency and sustainability of football clubs by discouraging them from continually operating at a loss, introduce more discipline and rationality on club finances, ensure that clubs settle their liabilities on a timely basis and encouraging long term investment in youth development and sporting infrastructure.
UEFA are implementing an updated set of regulations from 1 July 2022 ahead of the commencement of a new cycle and competition format in 2024/25. The existing “break-even” rule will remain, aimed at encouraging football clubs to operate on the basis of their own revenue. Owner investments of equity are allowed only within the acceptable deviation thresholds, as described below. In addition, the regulations provide that football clubs who are granted a UEFA license by their national association, based largely on physical infrastructure and personnel criteria set out by UEFA, and who then qualify for a UEFA club competition based on sporting grounds, will then be required to comply with a “monitoring” process. The monitoring process involves the submission of certain financial information (a break-even test and payables analysis) to the Club Financial Control Body (“CFCB”). The CFCB is part of UEFA’s Organs for the Administration of Justice and comprises a team of independent financial and legal experts. The CFCB will review financial submissions and decide what sanctions, if any, to apply to non-compliant clubs. Any appeal must be made directly to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Potential sanctions for non-compliance with the FFP regulations include a reprimand/warning, withholding of prize money, fines, prohibition on registering new players for UEFA club competitions and ultimately exclusion from UEFA club competitions.
The monitoring process includes so called ‘breach indicators’ which if in existence trigger additional reporting requirements to UEFA such as accelerated reporting of audited financial information and projections for the competition season and future seasons. Breach indicators include an auditor going concern qualification, a worsening balance sheet net liabilities position, a break-even deficit in any individual year and sustainable debt and player transfer balance indicators. The sustainable debt indicator is triggered if debt at the reporting date is greater than €30 million and greater than seven times the average of relevant earnings (as defined by UEFA). The player transfer balance indicator is triggered if a club incurs a deficit on net player transfers in excess of €100 million in any transfer window within the license season.
Ahead of registration for UEFA club competitions for the 2022/23 season we submitted our payables analysis and break-even assessment under the previous FFP regulations. The break-even test result, initially assessed on the cumulative sum of the financial information for the two years ended 30 June 2021 (but which would ordinarily have been extended to the cumulative sum of the financial information for the three years ended 30 June 2019 should there have been any breach indicators) was positive (i.e., a surplus). The payables analysis is typically carried out at 30 June prior to the competition season and is required in respect of payments to other clubs for transfer fees, payments to staff including players and football staff and payments to tax authorities. UEFA has already imposed sanctions on clubs who have breached the Licensing and FFP regulations, ranging from monetary fines, restrictions on wages and first team squad size and limitation on transfer expenditures, to exclusion from UEFA club competitions.
With respect to the break-even assessment, a club must demonstrate that its relevant “football” income is equal to or exceeds its “football” expenses. The prior permitted level of deficit was limited over the threeyear assessment period to just €5 million, although a larger deficit of up to €30 million was permitted provided is the deficit was reduced to the €5 million acceptable deviation by equity contributions from equity participants and/or related parties. Any club which exceeded the €30 million limit will automatically be in breach of the break-even rule, unless it had sufficient surpluses in the two years prior to the assessment period, irrespective of any equity contributions. With respect to the updated break-even assessment, a club must
51

continue to demonstrate that its relevant “football” income is equal to or exceeds its “football” expenses. The newly permitted level of deficit is still limited over the three-year assessment period to just €5 million, although a larger deficit of up to €60 million is permitted provided the deficit is reduced to the €5 million acceptable deviation by equity contributions from equity participants and/or related parties or the club has existing positive equity in excess of the loss. Any club which exceeds the €60 million limit will automatically be in breach of the break-even rule. It is no longer possible to utilize surpluses gained in the two years prior to the assessment period. Another key change to the regulations is that previously depreciation of tangible fixed assets, youth development, women’s team and community expenditure were excluded from the break-even test. In the updated regulations, clubs must either have positive equity to the value of the aforementioned expenditure to be able to exclude them from the calculation or they must be covered by equity contributions from equity participants and/or related parties (in addition to any allowable deficit contributions).
The larger deficit of up to €60 million over the three-year period can be increased to €90 million based on specific financial criteria being met, aimed at benefitting clubs that are financially sustainable.
The new regulations will see clubs subject to squad cost controls for the first time. The cost control rule restricts spending on player and coach wages, transfers, and agent fees to 70% of club revenues. The cost control rule is a calendar year test which will be tested during the season to place greater emphasis on current financial information. This allows UEFA to identify breaches as they occur. The gradual implementation will see the percentage at 90% in 2023/24, 80% in 2024/25, and 70% from 2025/26 onwards. This requirement provides a direct measure between squad costs and income to encourage more performance-related costs and to limit the market inflation of wages and transfer costs of players.
European clubs reported operating losses in excess of €1 billion in 2019/20 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic after seven years of operating profits. European clubs had generated more than €5.7 billion in operating profits from fiscal year 2013 to 2019, compared with operating losses of €0.7 billion during the period from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2013. The losses suffered during COVID-19 have partially contributed to UEFA’s drive to ensure clubs are stable and keep costs under control.
In 2015, UEFA announced some changes to the FFP regulations aimed primarily at clubs undergoing a business restructuring. Instead of breaching the FFP regulations and being subject to sanctions, the amended regulations enable clubs to voluntarily approach the CFCB with a business plan which demonstrates how they are going to remedy their short-term breach of FFP regulations and achieve break-even compliance over a four-year time period. If the business plan is approved by the CFCB the club would not be subject to sanctions for the restructuring year which results in a breach of the FFP regulations.
We support and operate within the financial fair play regulations, and do not believe it will adversely impact our ability to continue to attract some of the best players in the coming years.
Premier League Profitability and Sustainability Rules
The Premier League Profitability and Sustainability Rules were introduced during the 2015/16 season, implementing a break-even rule similar to the break-even test of the UEFA Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play Regulations and aimed at encouraging Premier League clubs to operate within their means. Potential sanctions for non-compliance with the profitability and sustainability regulations include significant fines, player transfer restrictions and Premier League points deduction.
Our most recent break-even assessment under the Premier League Profitability and Sustainability Rules was submitted in March 2022, based on our fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020 audited financial statements. The break-even test is based on a club’s audited pre-tax earnings. If the break-even test results are positive, no further action is required until the next break-even test. If the initial test is negative, a club is re-tested, using the UEFA definition of “adjusted earnings before tax,” which allows credit for depreciation of tangible fixed assets and expenditure on youth development and community programs. If these second test results are negative by £15 million or less, no further action is required. If a club’s losses exceed £15 million but are not more than £105 million, the club’s ownership must provide secure funding to avoid sanctions. If these results are negative by more than £105 million, regardless of ownership funding, Premier League sanctions will apply. Our break-even test result submitted in March 2022 was positive.
52

Due to the reduced revenues and financial implications caused by COVID-19, the Premier League Profitability and Sustainability Rules have been revised. Our March 2022 submission was based on our fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020 audited financial statements. The allowable loss amount was increased to an amount equivalent to the measurable impact of COVID-19 on the club. For the submission in 2022, the three-year period will be fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019 plus the average of fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2021, adjusted for the measurable impact of COVID-19.
As with the UEFA Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play Regulations, we support and operate within the Premier League Profitability and Sustainability Rules, and do not believe it will adversely impact our ability to continue to attract some of the best players in the coming years.
Social Responsibility
Manchester United Foundation
We are committed to a wide-ranging corporate social responsibility program through Manchester United Foundation (the “Foundation”). The associated charity of Manchester United, the Foundation’s vision focuses on a future where all young people are empowered to achieve their goals. The ongoing commitment to young people is to help ensure that, despite uncertainty in the world around them, those with whom the Foundation works on a daily basis continue to feel supported, inspired, and positive about their future.
With a strong focus on youth mental health, the Foundation’s objectives are to ensure young people have access to our community and educational outreach programs to help them make positive choices in their lives and develop in the following areas:
• Physical and mental wellbeing (living a happier, healthier life)
• Social wellbeing (bringing a sense of belonging to people and their communities)
• Employability (improving educational and employment outcomes)
The Foundation has partnerships with over 30 high schools and SEND schools across Greater Manchester, with a presence in all ten boroughs, in which full-time coaches are based to work with the pupils, feeder primary schools and within the local community to build lasting relationships. Other initiatives, such as Street Reds evening football sessions, girls’ development provision, and a disability and inclusion program, provide free football, alternative activities, qualifications and work experience opportunities for young people across Greater Manchester.
The Foundation fulfils all charitable activity for Manchester United, including supporting the Sir Bobby Charlton Foundation (finding innovative solutions to create a landmine-free world), and managing the club’s long-term partnership with global children’s organization Unicef. The Foundation also supports external charities by providing signed items for their own fundraising purposes.
In 2021/22 the Foundation celebrated 15 years of supporting fans and communities, in which time it has impacted the lives of over 75,000 young people, its community projects have increased from four to 97, and over £50,000 has been raised for other charitable causes.
Equality, Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to equality, diversity and inclusion, and the Club’s activity in these areas falls within the wide-ranging All Red All Equal initiative.
The Club continues to work toward gender parity across its Leadership teams, as the Executive Leadership has grown to 25% female representation, whilst the senior leaders and managers is at a 40% female to male ratio. The Club is also committed to enhancing diversity amongst senior roles as it works toward a more inclusive representation of leaders from different ethnicities, backgrounds, gender identities, sexual orientations, disabilities, social mobility and economic backgrounds. For example, the Club is one of the first signatories to The FA Football Leadership Code that monitors organizations’ recruitment practices towards attracting and appointing talent from Black, Asian and Mixed Heritage backgrounds. In addition,
53

the Club continues strengthening its ties with the Black community by offering opportunities to future leaders through the 1000 Black interns program. We have also renewed our strategic partnership with LGBTQ+ equality charity Stonewall. The collaboration with Stonewall saw the Club sign up for the ‘Diversity Champions’ programme, which helps employers embed LGBTQ+ inclusion in the workplace and gain access to expert consultation, training and resource from Stonewall.
Key developments over the past season have included the Club working towards re-accrediting its Advance Level award through the Premier League’s Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Standard. In addition, Manchester United is a signatory to The FA’s Football Leadership Diversity Code, which targets diversifying the Club’s leadership and coaching teams.
This year, the Club also launched SEE RED, a new campaign under the All Red All Equal initiative, to confront the scourge of racism and discrimination in the game. SEE RED included a thought-provoking video which challenges fans to think, ‘Without diversity, who would we be? What would the Club’s history books say?’. The multi-channel campaign also calls on fans to take responsibility for reporting incidents of racism or other hate crimes. In addition, the campaign encourages fans to stand up for those who may be receiving discriminatory abuse. Fans can report online discriminatory abuse via the SEE RED reporting platform on the club website. The campaign was launched with extensive media and social media coverage that has continued as an ‘always on’ campaign.
We have continued to support football-wide campaigns and initiatives within the lens of All Red All Equal—such as the Premier League’s ‘No Room for Racism’ initiative.
A range of active Employee Networks and an Equality Committee is in place to promote equality, diversity and inclusion at Manchester United internally and externally. For example, for International Women’s Day this year, Manchester United launched the ‘Change the Game’ initiative. As a result, the Club celebrated women helping drive gender diversity across Manchester United and transforming attitudes towards women in football—on and off the pitch.
From an overarching perspective, the Club’s equality, diversity and inclusion commitment is part of the Business Strategy and supported by the Club’s values. Furthermore, equality, diversity and inclusion are being embedded throughout the Club as part of the People strategy and Equality, Diversity and Inclusion strategy. These strategies outline how all business areas are responsible for equality, diversity and inclusion to ensure that the Club, its workforce and Old Trafford remain a diverse, welcoming, accessible and inclusive environment for all.
Sustainability
We recognize the need to move towards a more sustainable economy. We have taken steps to reduce the amount of waste we produce and divert all operational waste away from landfills. We also aim to minimize the use of non-renewable materials, improve our recycling rates and use more recycled materials. We have achieved the Carbon Trust Standard, which recognizes organizations that take a best practice approach to measuring and managing their environmental impacts, and through our Reds Go Green initiative we will continue to build on our carbon and renewable energy strategy to improve our performance further. We have also achieved the Gold Standard in Green Tourism Business Certification, which recognizes the commitment of tourism businesses that are actively working to become more sustainable. We also offset carbon emissions generated from our pre season tour to Thailand and Australia through investment in a reforestation project in Western Australia.
Intellectual Property
We consider intellectual property to be important to the operation of our business and critical to driving growth in our Commercial revenue, particularly with respect to sponsorship revenue. Certain of our commercial partners have rights to use our intellectual property. In order to protect our brand we generally have contractual rights to approve uses of our intellectual property by our commercial partners.
We consider our brand to be a key business asset and therefore have a portfolio of Manchester United related registered trademarks and trademark applications. The historic emphasis has been on seeking and maintaining trademark registrations for the words “Manchester United” and the club crest but that emphasis
54

was then extended to cover the devil device and the words “MUTV” and “Man Utd”. We also actively procure copyright protection and copyright ownership of materials such as literary works, logos, photographic images and audio visual footage.
Enforcement of our trademark rights is important in maintaining the value of the Manchester United brand. There are numerous instances of third parties infringing our trademarks, for example, through the manufacture and sale of counterfeit products. While it would be cost-prohibitive to take action in all instances, our aim is to consistently reduce the number of Manchester United related trademark infringements by carrying out coordinated, cost-effective enforcement action on a global basis following investigation of suspected trademark infringements. Enforcement action takes a variety of forms. In the United Kingdom, we work with enforcement authorities such as trading standards and customs authorities to seize counterfeit goods and to stop the activities of unauthorized sellers. Overseas enforcement action is taken by approved lawyers and investigators. Those lawyers and investigators are instructed to work with, where feasible, representatives of other football clubs and brands that are experiencing similar issues within the relevant country in order that our enforcement action costs can be minimized as far as possible. We also work with the Premier League in respect of infringements that affect multiple Premier League clubs, in particular in Asia. We also take direct legal action against infringers, for example, by issuing cease and desist letters or seeking compensation when we consider that it is appropriate to do so.
In relation to materials for which copyright protection is available (such as literary works, logos, photographic images and audio visual footage), our current practice is generally to secure copyright ownership where possible and appropriate. For example, where we are working with third parties and copyright protected materials are being created, we generally try to secure an assignment of the relevant copyright as part of the commercial contract. However, it is not always possible to secure copyright ownership. For example, in the case of audio visual footage relating to football competitions, copyright will generally vest in the competition organizer and any exploitation by Manchester United Football Club of such footage will be the subject of a license from the competition organizer.
As part of our ongoing investment in intellectual property, we have implemented a program to detect intellectual property infringement in a digital environment and which facilitates taking action against infringers.
Competition
From a business perspective, we compete across a wide variety of industries and within many different markets. We believe our primary sources of competition include, but are not limited to:
• Football clubs: We compete against other football clubs in the Premier League for match attendance and Matchday revenue. We compete against football clubs around Europe and the rest of the world to attract the best players and coaches in the global transfer and football staff markets.
• Television media: We receive media income primarily from the Premier League and UEFA media contracts, each of which is collectively negotiated. Further details of such arrangements are set out in the section headed “—Revenue Sectors—Broadcasting.” On a collective level, and in respect of those media rights we retain, we compete against other types of television programming for broadcaster attention and advertiser income both domestically and in other markets around the world.
• Digital media: We compete against other digital content providers for consumer attention and leisure time, advertiser income and consumer e-commerce activity.
• Merchandise and apparel: We compete against other providers of sports apparel and equipment.
• Sponsorship: As a result of the international recognition and quality of our brand, we compete against many different outlets for corporate sponsorship and advertising income, including other sports and other sports teams, other entertainment and events, television and other traditional and digital media outlets.
• Live entertainment: We compete against alternative forms of live entertainment for the sale of Matchday tickets, including other live sports, concerts, festivals, theatre and similar events.
55

As a result, we do not believe there is any single market for which we have a well-defined group of competitors.

Real Property

We own or lease property dedicated to our football and other operations. The most significant of our real properties is Old Trafford. The following table sets out our key owned and leased properties. In connection with our revolving facilities, our secured term loan facility and the senior secured notes, several of our owned properties, including Old Trafford are encumbered with land charges as security for all obligations under those agreements, although the Manchester International Freight Terminal and the Carrington training ground are not encumbered.

Customers
See “Item 3.D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We are exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to Premier League and UEFA media contracts as well as our key commercial and transfer contracts.” Our top customer was the Premier League, who represented 25.1%, 35.9% and 23.2% of our total revenue in each of the years ended 30 June 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our second largest customer was adidas, who represented 13.1%, 15.7% and 15.3% of our total revenue in each of the years ended 30 June 2022, 2021 and 2020.
ITEM 4A. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
None.
ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Overview
We are one of the most popular and successful sports teams in the world, playing one of the most popular spectator sports on Earth. Through our 144-year heritage we have won 66 trophies, including a record 20 English league titles, enabling us to develop what we believe is one of the world’s leading sports brands and a global community of 1.1 billion fans and followers. Our large, passionate community provides Manchester United with a worldwide platform to generate significant revenue from multiple sources, including sponsorship, merchandising, product licensing, broadcasting and Matchday. We attract leading global companies such as adidas, Kohler, TeamViewer and Tezos that want access and exposure to our community of followers and association with our brand.
Old Trafford welcomed fans back at full capacity throughout the 2021/22 season, having operated without fans in attendance for 33 of 34 home matches in fiscal 2021. The Museum and Stadium Tour and the Megastore were also open to visitors throughout the period having being closed in 2020/21.
The impact of the above is an increase in Matchday and Commercial revenues for the year ended 30 June 2022. This has been partially offset by decreased Broadcasting revenues as a result of fewer games being played in the period with the prior year including the impact of completing the COVID-19 affected 2019/20 season.
How We Generate Revenue
We operate and manage our business as a single reporting segment—the operation of professional sports teams. We review our revenue through three principal sectors—Commercial, Broadcasting and Matchday—and within the Commercial revenue sector, we have two revenue streams which monetize our global brand: sponsorship revenue; and retail, merchandising, apparel & product licensing revenue. For additional information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition and results of operation, see “Item 3.D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.”

Revenue Drivers
Commercial
Commercial revenue is derived from sponsors and commercial partners. We generate our Commercial revenue with low fixed costs and small incremental costs for each additional sponsor, making our commercial operations a relatively high margin and scalable part of our business and a driver of growth for our overall profitability. Total Commercial revenue for the year ended 30 June 2022 was £257.8 million.
Sponsorship
We monetize the value of our global brand and community of followers through sponsorship relationships with leading international and regional companies around the globe. To better capitalize on the strength of our brand, we have developed a segmentation sponsorship strategy. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—Revenue Sectors—Commercial—Sponsorship—Our Sponsors” for some of our global and regional sponsors as at 1 July 2022.
A partnership with Manchester United provides corporations with the ability to associate themselves with the highly popular Manchester United brand and a global marketing platform to quickly and effectively amplify their brand and message to their potential customers.
For the 2021/22 season, our shirt sponsor was TeamViewer and in February 2022 we announced a new multi-year training kit partnership with Tezos. Tezos is one of the world’s most advanced and sustainable blockchains, enabling fast, secure and efficient digital interactions without the need for intermediaries. Total sponsorship revenue for the year ended 30 June 2022 was £147.9 million. Revenue for the year ended 30 June 2021 was impacted by COVID-19 variations and the cancellation of the 2020/21 first team pre season tour due to travel restrictions.
Retail, Merchandising, Apparel & Product Licensing
Our retail, merchandising, apparel & product licensing business includes the sale of sports apparel, training and leisure wear and other clothing featuring the Manchester United brand as well as other licensed products from coffee mugs to bedspreads. These products are distributed on a global basis through Manchester United branded retail stores and e-commerce platform, as well as through our partners’ wholesale distribution channels.
We have a 10-year agreement with adidas with respect to our global technical sponsorship and dualbranded licensing rights, which began on 1 August 2015. See “Item 4. Information on the Company— Revenue Sectors—Commercial—Retail, Merchandising, Apparel & Product Licensing” for additional information regarding our agreement with adidas.
Total retail, merchandising, apparel & product licensing revenue for the year ended 30 June 2022 was £109.9 million. Revenue for the year ended 30 June 2021 was impacted by COVID-19 and the partial closure of the Old Trafford Megastore.
Broadcasting
We benefit from the distribution of live football content directly from the revenue we receive and indirectly through increased global exposure for our commercial partners. Broadcasting revenue is derived from our share of the global broadcasting rights relating to the Premier League, Champions League and other competitions. The growing popularity of the Premier League and Champions League in international markets and the associated increases in media rights values have been major drivers of the increase in our overall Broadcasting revenue in recent years.
Season 2022/23 will be the first year of a new three-year (2022/23−2024/25) Premier League broadcasting rights cycle. All seven live UK packages were sold to the incumbent broadcasters—five to Sky Sports, one to BT Sport and the final one to Amazon Prime Video who was a new entrant in the previous cycle. The value generated from the sale was consistent with the prior cycle and the terms were agreed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The international broadcasting rights for the new cycle represent a 28% uplift on the previous
58

cycle, with international rights equaling domestic rights for the first time driven primarily by increases in North America and Europe. Overall growth for the new cycle is 16%. The ratio between the maximum and minimum broadcasting revenue that a club can receive from the Premier League in a season is capped at 1.8: 1. The international revenue growth will be allocated to merit payments, as this cap has not yet been reached, and will therefore benefit the higher placed teams.
Our participation in the Premier League and Champions League, Europa League or Europa Conference League (and consequently, our receipt of the revenue generated by these broadcasting contracts) is predicated on the success of our men’s first team, and if our men’s first team fails to qualify for these UEFA club competitions or is relegated from the Premier League in any given season, our Broadcasting revenue for that and subsequent fiscal years will be adversely impacted, partially offset by lower operating expenses. As a result of our men’s first team performance during the 2021/22 season, our men’s first team will participate in the 2022/23 Europa League rather than the Champions League.
In addition, MUTV delivers Manchester United programming and other content to territories around the world. MUTV generated total revenue of £6.8 million, £6.3 million and £7.9 million for each of the years ended 30 June 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Total Broadcasting revenue for the year ended 30 June 2022 was £214.9 million.
Matchday
Matchday revenue is a function of the number of games played in front of a crowd at Old Trafford, the size and seating composition of Old Trafford, attendance at our matches and the prices of tickets and hospitality sales. A significant driver of Matchday revenue is the number of home games we play at Old Trafford in front of a crowd, which is ordinarily based on 19 Premier League matches and any additional matches resulting from the success of our men’s first team in the FA Cup, EFL Cup and UEFA club competitions. Our participation in the Premier League and UEFA club competitions (and consequently, our receipt of the revenue generated by these matches) is predicated on the success of our men’s first team, and if our men’s first team fails to qualify for UEFA club competitions or is relegated from the Premier League in any given season, our Matchday revenue for that and subsequent fiscal years will be adversely impacted, partially offset by lower resulting expenses. Average attendance for our home Premier League matches played in front of a crowd has been over 99% for each season since the 1997/98 season, with strong attendance for UEFA club competitions, FA Cup and EFL Cup matches. Total Matchday revenue for the year ended 30 June 2022 was £110.5 million. All the home matches in the year were played with Old Trafford Stadium operating at full capacity after government restrictions in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic were removed. These restrictions significantly affected Matchday revenue in the year ended 30 June 2021.
Other Factors That Affect Our Financial Performance
Employee benefit expenses
Player and staff compensation comprise the majority of our operating costs. Of our total operating costs, player costs, which consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits and national insurance contributions are the primary component. Compensation to non-player staff, which includes our manager and coaching staff, also accounts for a significant portion. Competition from top clubs in the Premier League and Europe has resulted in increases in player and manager salaries, forcing clubs to spend an increasing amount on player and staff compensation, and we expect this trend to continue. In addition, as our commercial operations grow, we expect our headcount and related expenses to increase as well.
Other operating expenses
Our other operating expenses generally include certain variable costs such as Matchday catering, policing, security stewarding and cleaning at Old Trafford, visitor gateshare for domestic cups, and costs related to the delivery on media and commercial sponsorship contracts. Other operating expenses also include certain fixed costs, such as property costs, maintenance, human resources, training and developments costs, and professional fees. Our other operating expenses are subject to inflationary pressures and as such, can increase over time.
59

Amortization, depreciation and impairment
We amortize the capitalized costs associated with the acquisition of players’ and key football management staff registrations. These costs are amortized over the period of the employment contract agreed with a player/key football management staff. If a player or key football management staff extends his contract prior to the end of the pre-existing period of employment, the remaining unamortized portion of the acquisition cost is amortized over the period of the new contract. Changes in amortization of the costs of players’ and key football management staff registrations from year to year and period to period reflect additional fees paid for the acquisition of players and key football management staff, the impact of contract extensions and the disposal of registrations. As such, increased players’ and key football management staff registration costs in any period could cause higher amortization in that period and in future periods and have a negative impact on our results of operations. Moreover, to the extent that the player and key football management staff registration costs vary from period to period, this may drive variability in our results of operations. We also amortize the capitalized costs associated with the acquisition of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which is typically between 3 and 10 years.
Depreciation primarily reflects a straight-line depreciation on investments made in property, plant and equipment. Depreciation over the periods under review results primarily from the depreciation of Old Trafford, including incremental improvements made to Old Trafford each season.
Impairment charges arise when an asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. Assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Exceptional items
Exceptional operating costs are those costs that in management’s judgment need to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence in order to provide a proper understanding of our results of operations and financial condition.
Profit on disposal of intangible assets
We recognize profits or losses on the disposal of intangible assets (primarily players’ registrations) in our statement of profit or loss. Acquisitions and disposals of players are discretionary and we make transfer decisions based upon the requirements of our first teams and the overall availability of players. These requirements and the availability of players, and resulting profits or losses on disposals, may vary from period to period, contributing to variability in our results of operations between periods.
Finance (costs)/income
A key component of our expenses during each of the past three fiscal years has been interest costs and revaluations of our USD borrowings. We expect interest expense to continue to be a significant component of our expenses. See “Item 5.B. Liquidity and Capital Resources—Indebtedness.”
Taxes
During each of the three years ended 30 June 2022, 2021 and 2020, our principal operating subsidiaries were tax residents in the United Kingdom. During the same years, we were subject to a weighted UK statutory tax rate of 19.0% each year.
Although we are organized as a Cayman Islands exempted company, we report as a US domestic corporation for US federal income tax purposes. As a result, our worldwide income is also subject to US taxes at the US statutory rate (currently 21%).
In May 2021, a statutory tax rate of 25% was substantively enacted in the UK, which will take effect from April 2023. We expect to utilize a credit in the United States for UK taxes paid and therefore we do not expect to be double taxed on our income. We expect our future cash tax rate to align more closely to the UK statutory tax rate of 25% once this rate takes effect.
60

On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, which introduced a corporate minimum tax that would be imposed on certain corporations at a 15% rate and an excise tax of 1% that would, in some cases, be imposed on stock buybacks and stock redemptions by corporations. These changes could impact our tax liabilities and the recognition of the US deferred tax asset in the future, among other impacts. The Internal Revenue Service or other authorities may also issue regulations or other guidance in the future that could modify how these taxes or other provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act will be applied. In addition, other changes to the US federal tax law have also been proposed from time to time; however, it is not yet clear if or what additional changes will be made or when, or what impact any such changes will have on us.
We may also be subject to US state and local income (franchise) taxes based generally upon where we are doing business. These tax rates vary by jurisdiction and the tax base. Generally, state and local taxes are deductible for US federal income tax purposes. Furthermore, because most of our subsidiaries are disregarded from their owner for US federal income tax purposes, we are not able to control the timing of much of our US federal income tax exposure. In calculating our liability for US federal income tax, however, certain of our deductible expenses are higher than the amount of those same expenses under UK corporation tax rules, owing to differences in the relevant rules of the two jurisdictions and the related difference in the opening book versus tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Finally, our UK tax liability can be credited against our US federal income tax liabilities, subject to US rules and limitations.
Seasonality
We experience seasonality in our revenue and cash flow, limiting the overall comparability and predictability of interim financial periods. In any given interim period, our total revenue can vary based on the number of games played in that period, which affects the amount of Matchday and Broadcasting revenue recognized. Similarly, certain of our costs derive from hosting games at Old Trafford, and these costs will also vary based on the number of games played in the period. We historically recognize the most revenue in our second and third fiscal quarters due to the scheduling of matches. However, a strong performance by our men’s first team in UEFA club competitions and domestic cups could result in significant additional Broadcasting and Matchday revenue, and consequently we may also recognize the most revenue in our fourth fiscal quarter in those years. Our cash flow may also vary among interim periods due to the timing of significant payments from major commercial agreements. As such, though we report interim results of operations for our first, second and third fiscal quarters, in managing our business, setting goals and assessing performance we focus primarily on our full-year results of operations rather than our interim results of operations.

Revenue
Total revenue for the year ended 30 June 2022 was £583.2 million, an increase of £89.1 million, or 18.0%, compared to the year ended 30 June 2021, as a result of an increase in revenue in our commercial and Matchday sectors and a decrease in revenue in our broadcasting sector, as described below.
Commercial revenue
Commercial revenue for the year ended 30 June 2022 was £257.8 million, an increase of £25.6 million, or 11.0%, over the year ended 30 June 2021.
• Sponsorship revenue for the year ended 30 June 2022 was £147.9 million, an increase of £7.7 million, or 5.5%, over the year ended 30 June 2021, primarily due to the impact of new sponsorship agreements. The prior year was affected by COVID-19 related variations; and
• Retail, merchandising, apparel & product licensing revenue for the year ended 30 June 2022 was £109.9 million, an increase of £17.9 million, or 19.5%, over the year ended 30 June 2021, primarily due to the closure of the Megastore in the prior year and the return of fans in the current year.
Broadcasting revenue
Broadcasting revenue for the year ended 30 June 2022 was £214.9 million, a decrease of £39.9 million, or 15.7%, over the year ended 30 June 2021, primarily due to playing twenty-two fewer home and away games across all competitions with the prior year including the impact of completing the COVID-19 affected 2019/20 season.
Matchday revenue
Matchday revenue for the year ended 30 June 2022 was £110.5 million, an increase of £103.4 million, or 1,456.3%, over the year ended 30 June 2021, due to the return of fans to Old Trafford. In the prior year, all matches prior to the final home match of the season were played behind closed doors due to COVID-19 restrictions.
Total operating expenses
Total operating expenses (defined as employee benefit expenses, other operating expenses, depreciation and impairment, amortization and exceptional items) for the year ended 30 June 2022 were £692.6 million, an increase of £154.2 million, or 28.6%, over the year ended 30 June 2021.
Employee benefit expenses
Employee benefit expenses for the year ended 30 June 2022 were £384.2 million, an increase of £61.6 million, or 19.1%, over the year ended 30 June 2021, primarily due increased investment in the first team playing squad.
Other operating expenses
Other operating expenses for the year ended 30 June 2022 were £117.9 million, an increase of £41.5 million, or 54.3%, over the year ended 30 June 2021. This includes the impact of all home games being played in front of a full capacity crowd and costs related to the increased activity at the Old Trafford Megastore. In the prior year, all but one home games were played behind closed doors.
Depreciation and impairment
Depreciation and impairment for the year ended 30 June 2022 amounted to £14.3 million, a decrease of £0.7 million, or 4.7%, over the year ended 30 June 2021.
Amortization
Amortization, primarily of registrations, for the year ended 30 June 2022 was £151.5 million, an increase of £27.1 million, or 21.8%, over the year ended 30 June 2021, due to investment in the first team
63

playing squad. The unamortized balance of registrations as of 30 June 2022 was £316.2 million, of which £130.6 million is expected to be amortized in the year ending 30 June 2023. The remaining balance is expected to be amortized over the three years ending 30 June 2026. This does not take into account player acquisitions after 30 June 2022, which would have the effect of increasing the amortization expense in future periods, nor does it consider player departures subsequent to 30 June 2022, which would have the effect of decreasing future amortization charges. Furthermore, any contract renegotiations would also impact future charges.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items for the year ended 30 June 2022 were a cost of £24.7m. This includes compensation due to former men’s first team managers, certain members of the playing, coaching and scouting staff, and certain non-playing staff. The cost also includes additional contributions we expect to pay towards the Football League pension scheme deficit based upon the latest actuarial valuation. Exceptional items for the prior year were £nil.
Profit on disposal of intangible assets
Profit on disposal of intangible assets for the year ended 30 June 2022 was £22.0 million, compared to a profit of £7.4 million for the year ended 30 June 2021. The profit on disposal of intangible assets for the year ended 30 June 2022 primarily related to the disposal of James (Leeds) plus contingent fees and sell-on fees relating to former players. The profit on disposal of intangible assets for the year ended 30 June 2021 primarily related to the disposal of Smalling (Roma) plus contingent fees relating to former players, partially offset by a loss on the disposal of Sanchez (Inter Milan).
Net finance (costs)/ income
Net finance costs for the year ended 30 June 2022 were £62.2 million, compared to net finance income of £12.9 million for the year ended 30 June 2021, primarily due to an unfavorable swing foreign exchange rates resulting in unrealized foreign exchange losses on unhedged USD borrowings in the current year compared to unrealized foreign exchange gains in the prior year.
Income tax
The income tax credit for the year ended 30 June 2022 was £34.1 million, compared to £68.2 million for the year ended 30 June 2021. The credit in the year is primarily a result of deferred tax assets recognized in respect of losses arising in the year. The prior year expense arose from the write off of US deferred tax assets.
Safe Harbor
See the Section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this Annual Report.
B. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our primary cash requirements stem from the payment of transfer fees for the acquisition of players’ registrations, capital expenditure for the improvement of facilities at Old Trafford and Carrington, payment of interest on our borrowings, employee benefit expenses, other operating expenses and dividends on our Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares. Historically, we have met these cash requirements through a combination of operating cash flow and proceeds from transfer fees from the sale of players’ registrations. Our existing borrowings primarily consist of our secured term loan facility, our senior secured notes and outstanding drawdowns under our revolving facilities. We manage our cash flow interest rate risk where considered appropriate using interest rate swaps. Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting a portion of variable rate borrowings from floating to fixed rates. We have US dollar borrowings that we use to hedge our US dollar commercial revenue exposure. We continue to evaluate our financing options and may, from time to time, take advantage of opportunities to repurchase or refinance all or a portion of our existing indebtedness to the extent such opportunities arise.
While the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in UK government restrictions being reimposed in the future, the majority of such restrictions were lifted ahead of the start of the 2021/22 season, with Old Trafford stadium welcoming back fans at full capacity. We expect that the wider impact of
64

COVID-19 on future revenue streams and cash flows will vary but will generally depend on potential future UK and international governmental measures to manage the spread of the disease, including variants, the length of time that such measures remain in place, their impact on future consumer behavior, our ability to play football matches and continuation of matches played in front of a crowd and at full capacity. We believe we are well placed with a strong balance sheet, including cash resources as at 30 June 2022 of £121.2 million. All funds are held as cash and cash equivalents and therefore available on demand. As at 30 June 2022, we also had access to undrawn revolving facilities of £200 million. However, we cannot assure you that our cash generated from operations, cash and cash equivalents or cash available under our revolving facilities will be sufficient to meet our long-term future needs, particularly in light of the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the global economy and our business. We cannot assure you that we could obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all, including as a result of changes or volatility in the credit or capital markets, which affect our ability to borrow money or raise capital, including as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In fiscal year 2022, we paid cash dividends on our Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares of $0.09 per share on 30 July 2021, 7 January 2022 and 24 June 2022. The declaration and payment of any future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors or a committee thereof, and our expectations and policies regarding dividends are subject to change as our business needs, capital requirements or market conditions change.
Our business ordinarily generates a significant amount of cash from our Matchday revenues and commercial contractual arrangements at or near the beginning of our fiscal year, with a steady flow of other cash received throughout the fiscal year. In addition, we ordinarily generate a significant amount of our cash through advance receipts, including season tickets (which include general admission season tickets and seasonal hospitality tickets), most of which are received prior to the end of June for the following season. Our Broadcasting revenue from the Premier League and UEFA are paid periodically throughout the season, with primary payments made in late summer, December, January and the end of the football season. Our sponsorship and other commercial revenue tends to be paid either quarterly or annually in advance. However, while we typically have a high cash balance at the beginning of each fiscal year, this is largely attributable to deferred revenue, the majority of which falls under current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, and this deferred revenue is unwound through the statement of profit or loss over the course of the fiscal year. Over the course of a year, we use our cash on hand to pay employee benefit expenses, other operating expenses, interest payments and other liabilities as they become due. This typically results in negative working capital movement at certain times during the year. In the event it ever became necessary to access additional operating cash, we also have access to cash through our revolving facilities. As of 30 June 2022, we had £100 million of outstanding loans under our revolving facilities.
Pursuant to our contract with adidas, which began on 1 August 2015, the minimum guarantee payable by adidas over the 10-year term of the agreement is equal to £750 million, subject to certain adjustments. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—Revenue Sectors—Commercial—Retail, Merchandising, Apparel & Product Licensing” for additional information regarding our agreement with adidas.
We also maintain a mixture of long-term debt and capacity under our revolving facilities in order to ensure that we have sufficient funds available for short-term working capital requirements and for investment in the playing squad and other capital projects.
Our cost base is more evenly spread throughout the fiscal year than our cash inflows. Employee benefit expenses and fixed costs constitute the majority of our cash outflows and are generally paid evenly throughout the 12 months of the fiscal year.
In addition, transfer windows for acquiring and disposing of registrations occur in January and the summer. During these periods, we may require additional cash to meet our acquisition needs for new players and we may generate additional cash through the sale of existing registrations. Depending on the terms of the agreement, transfer fees may be paid or received by us in multiple installments, resulting in deferred cash paid or received. Although we have not historically drawn on our revolving facilities during the summer transfer window, if we seek to acquire players with values substantially in excess of the values of players we seek to sell, we may be required to utilize cash available from our revolving facilities to meet our cash needs.
65

Acquisition and disposal of registrations also affects our trade receivables and payables, which affects our overall working capital. Our trade receivables include accrued revenue from sponsors as well as transfer fees receivable from other football clubs, whereas our trade payables include transfer fees and other associated costs in relation to the acquisition of registrations.
Capital expenditures at Old Trafford Our stadium, Old Trafford, remains one of our key assets and a significant part of the overall experience
we provide to our followers. Old Trafford has been our home stadium since 1910 and has undergone significant changes over the years. To maintain the quality of service, enhance the fan experience and increase Matchday revenue, we continually invest in the refurbishment and regeneration of Old Trafford. Following a substantial development prior to the 2006/07 season, we expanded seating capacity at Old Trafford from approximately 68,000 to 74,240. In addition, we have continued to invest in improving hospitality suites and catering facilities through refurbishment programs. In 2022, we appointed master planners to explore options for potential future developments of Old Trafford.
We record these investments as capital expenditures. Capital expenditure at Old Trafford was £4.1 million, £3.7 million and £18.4 million for the years ended 30 June 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This includes carrying out major improvements at Old Trafford relating to the away changing rooms and upgrading the floodlighting system.
In addition, we spent approximately £0.7 million, £1.0 million and £1.9 million for the years ended 30 June 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively in connection with updating and expanding Carrington, our training facility.
Digital Media capital expenditure We intend to continue investing in our digital media assets, including our website, mobile application
and digital media capabilities.
Net intangible asset—registrations capital expenditure Our average net intangible asset—registrations capital expenditure over the last 5 years has been a cash
outflow of £120.4 million per fiscal year. However, net intangible asset—registrations capital expenditure has varied significantly from period to period, as shown in the table below, and while we expect that trend to continue, competition for talented players may force clubs to spend increasing amounts on player registration fees. We may explore new player acquisitions in connection with future transfer periods that may materially increase the amount of our net intangible asset—registrations capital expenditure. Actual cash used or generated from net intangible asset—registrations capital expenditure is recorded on our statement of cash flow under net cash outflow or inflow from investing activities.

Net cash inflow/(outflow) from operating activities
Cash generated from operations represents our operating results and net movements in our working capital. Our working capital is generally impacted by the timing of cash received from the sale of tickets and hospitality and other matchday revenues, broadcasting revenue from the Premier League and UEFA and commercial revenue. Cash generated from operations for the year ended 30 June 2022 was £121.7 million, a decrease of £16.1 million from £137.8 million for the year ended 30 June 2021. This is primarily due to reduced broadcasting revenue as a result of fewer games played in the year, partially offset by the return of fans to Old Trafford. Cash generated from operations for the year ended 30 June 2020 was £17.6 million.
Additional changes in net cash inflow/(outflow) from operating activities generally reflect our finance costs. We currently pay fixed rates of interest on our senior secured notes and variable rates of interest on our secured term loan facility and revolving facilities. We use interest rate swaps to manage the cash flow interest rate risk on our secured term loan facility. Such swaps have the economic effect of converting a portion of interest from variable rates to a fixed rate.
Interest paid was £20.6 million for the year ended 30 June 2022, an increase of £0.1 million on the year ended 30 June 2021. Interest on our senior secured notes is normally paid semi-annually, at the beginning of August and at the beginning of February. Interest paid for the year ended 30 June 2020 was £20.5 million.
Net cash inflow from operating activities was £96.4 million for the year ended 30 June 2022, a decrease of £16.7 million compared to a net cash inflow of £113.1 million for the year ended 30 June 2021. Net cash outflow from operating activities for the year ended 30 June 2020 was £3.8 million.

Net cash outflow from investing activities
Capital expenditure for the acquisition of intangible assets as well as for improvements to property, principally at Old Trafford and Carrington, are funded through cash flow generated from operations, proceeds from the sale of intangible assets and, if necessary, from our revolving facilities. Capital expenditure on the acquisition, disposal and trading of intangible assets tends to vary significantly from year to year depending on the requirements of our men’s first team, overall availability of players, our assessment of their relative value and competitive demand for players from other clubs. By contrast, capital expenditure on the purchase of property, plant and equipment tends to remain relatively stable as we continue to make improvements at Old Trafford and Carrington.
Net cash outflow from investing activities for the year ended 30 June 2022 was £93.4 million, a decrease of £5.9 million from £99.3 million for the year ended 30 June 2021. Net cash outflow from investing activities for the year ended 30 June 2020 was £212.9 million.
For the year ended 30 June 2022, net capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment was £8.3 million, an increase of £2.1 million from net expenditure of £6.2 million for the year ended 30 June 2021. Net capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment for the year ended 30 June 2020 was £21.3 million.
For the year ended 30 June 2022, net capital expenditure on intangible assets was £85.1 million, a decrease of £7.1 million from net expenditure of £92.2 million for the year ended 30 June 2021. Net capital expenditure for the year ended 30 June 2022 was mainly comprised of payments made for the acquisitions of Sancho, Varane and van de Beek and the extension of Fernandes, less payments received relating to the disposal of Lukaku.
Net capital expenditure for the year ended 30 June 2021 was mainly comprised of payments made for the acquisitions of Wan-Bissaka, Fernandes, Lukaku and van de Beek, less payments received relating to the disposal of Lukaku.
Net capital expenditure on intangible assets for the year ended 30 June 2020 was £191.6 million and was mainly comprised of payments made for the acquisitions of Fernandes, Fred, Lukaku, Maguire, Matic and Wan-Bissaka, less payments received relating to the disposal of Lukaku.
For the year ended 30 June 2022, net expenditure on derivative financial assets was £nil, compared to £0.9 million for the year ended 30 June 2021. Net expenditure on derivative financial assets for the year ended 30 June 2020 was £nil.
Net cash inflow/(outflow) from financing activities
Net cash inflow from financing activities for the year ended 30 June 2022 was £5.0 million, a decrease of £42.6 million compared to net cash inflow of £47.6 million for the year ended 30 June 2021. During the year ended 30 June 2022, we made a drawdown of £40.0 million on our revolving facilities and paid three cash dividends amounting to £33.6 million.
During the year ended 30 June 2021, we made a drawdown of £60.0 million on our revolving facilities and paid one dividend amounting to £10.7 million.
Net cash outflow from financing activities for the year ended 30 June 2020 was £46.4 million. During the year ended 30 June 2020, we acquired treasury shares amounting to £21.3 million and paid two semi-annual dividends amounting to £23.2m in the aggregate.
Indebtedness
Our primary sources of indebtedness consist of our senior secured notes, our secured term loan facility and our revolving facilities. As part of the security for our senior secured notes, our secured term loan facility and our revolving facilities, substantially all of our assets are subject to liens and mortgages.
Description of principal indebtedness
Senior secured notes
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Manchester United Football Club Limited, issued $425 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.79% senior secured notes (which we refer to throughout this Annual
69

Report as the “senior secured notes”). As of 30 June 2022 the sterling equivalent of £347.2 million (net of unamortized issue costs of £2.6 million) was outstanding. The outstanding principal amount was $425.0 million. The senior secured notes mature on 25 June 2027.
The senior secured notes are guaranteed by Red Football Limited, Red Football Junior Limited, Manchester United Limited and MU Finance Limited and secured against substantially all of the assets of those entities and Manchester United Football Club Limited. These entities are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Manchester United plc.
The note purchase agreement governing the senior secured notes contains a financial maintenance covenant requiring us to maintain consolidated profit for the period before depreciation, amortization of, and profit/(loss) on disposal of, intangible assets, exceptional items, net finance costs, and tax (“EBITDA”) of not less than £65 million for each 12 month testing period (with the flexibility to reduce this to £25 million during the period 31 March 2021 to 30 September 2022 inclusive). We are able to claim certain dispensations from complying with the consolidated EBITDA floor including up to twice (in non-consecutive financial years) during the life of the senior secured notes if we fail to qualify for the first round group stages (or its equivalent from time to time) of the Champions League. The impact of IFRS 16 is excluded for the purpose of covenant compliance testing. The covenant is tested on a quarterly basis and we were in compliance with the covenant for each quarter throughout the financial year.
The note purchase agreement governing the senior secured notes contains events of default typical for securities of this type, as well as customary covenants and restrictions on the activities of Red Football Limited and each of Red Football Limited’s subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, the incurrence of additional indebtedness; dividends or distributions in respect of capital stock or certain other restricted payments or investments; entering into agreements that restrict distributions from restricted subsidiaries; the sale or disposal of assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries; transactions with affiliates; the incurrence of liens; and mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of Red Football Limited’s assets. The covenants in the note purchase agreement governing the senior secured notes are subject to certain thresholds and exceptions described in the note purchase agreement governing the senior secured notes.
The senior secured notes may be redeemed in part, in an amount not less than 5% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior secured notes then outstanding, or in full, at any time at 100% of the principal amount plus a “make-whole” premium of an amount equal to the discounted value (based on the US Treasury rate) of the remaining interest payments due on the senior secured notes up to 25 June 2027.

Secured term loan facility

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Manchester United Football Club Limited, has a secured term loan facility with Bank of America Europe Designated Activity Company as lender. As of 30 June 2022 the sterling equivalent of £183.2 million (net of unamortized issue costs of £2.0 million) was outstanding. The outstanding principal amount was $225.0 million. The remaining balance of the secured term loan facility is repayable on 6 August 2029, although the Group has the option to repay the secured term loan facility at any time before then.

Loans under the secured term loan facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to US dollar LIBOR (provided that if the rate is less than zero, LIBOR shall be deemed to be zero) plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin, if no event of default has occurred and is continuing, means the following:

Revolving facilities

Our revolving facilities agreement originally dated 22 May 2015 (as amended on 7 October 2015, amended and restated on 4 April 2019, 4 March 2021 and 10 December 2021) (the “initial revolving facility”) allows Manchester United Football Club Limited (or any direct or indirect subsidiary of Red Football Limited that becomes a borrower thereunder) to borrow up to £150 million from a syndicate of lenders with Bank of America Europe Designated Activity Company as agent and security trustee. As of 30 June 2022, we had £75 million in outstanding loans and £75 million in borrowing capacity under our revolving facilities agreement.

The initial revolving facility is scheduled to expire on 4 April 2025. Any amount still outstanding at that time will be due in full immediately on the applicable expiry date.

Any loan drawn under the initial revolving facility is required to be repaid on the last day of each of its interest periods. Amounts repaid may (subject to the terms of the revolving facilities agreement) be re-borrowed.

Loans under the initial revolving facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to SONIA plus a credit adjustment spread (or in relation to a loan in euros, EURIBOR or in relation to a loan in USD, SOFR plus a credit adjustment spread) (provided that if that rate is less than zero, SONIA or, as the case may be, EURIBOR or SOFR (as applicable), shall be deemed to be zero) plus the applicable margin.

The applicable margin, if no event of default has occurred and is continuing, means the following:

Off balance sheet arrangements
Transfer fees payable
Under the terms of certain contracts with other football clubs in respect of player transfers, additional amounts would be payable by us if certain specific performance conditions are met. As noted above, we estimate the fair value of any contingent consideration at the date of acquisition based on the probability of conditions being met and monitor this on an ongoing basis. The maximum additional amount that could be payable as of 30 June 2022 is £112.4 million.
Transfer fees receivable
Similarly, under the terms of contracts with other football clubs for player transfers, additional amounts would be payable to us if certain specific performance conditions are met. In accordance with the recognition criteria for contingent assets, such amounts are only disclosed by the Company when probable and recognized when virtually certain. As of 30 June 2022, we believe receipt of £nil to be probable.
Other commitments
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into capital commitments. These transactions are recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, as issued by the IASB, and are more fully disclosed therein.
As of 30 June 2022, we had not entered into any other off-balance sheet transactions.
C. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PATENTS AND LICENSES, ETC.
We do not currently have, and have not had during the past three years, any research and development policies in place. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—Intellectual Property” and note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information about our intellectual property and licenses, respectively.
D. TREND INFORMATION
Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report, we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events since 30 June 2022 that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our revenues, income, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause the disclosed financial information to be not necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial conditions.

E. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of our financial information requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions concerning the future. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
For a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of 30 June 2022 and 30 June 2021 and for the years ended 30 June 2022, 2021 and 2020 included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
We believe that the following accounting policies reflect the most critical estimates and assumptions and are significant to the consolidated financial statements.
We do not consider there to be any significant judgments in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
Recognition of revenue
Commercial
Commercial revenue (whether settled in cash or value in kind) comprises revenue receivable from the exploitation of the Manchester United brand through sponsorship and other commercial agreements, including minimum guaranteed revenue, revenue receivable from retailing Manchester United branded merchandise in the United Kingdom and licensing the manufacture, distribution and sale of such goods globally, and fees for the Manchester United men’s first team undertaking tours.
A number of our sponsorship contracts contain significant estimates in relation to our allocation and recognition of revenue in line with performance obligations. Minimum guaranteed revenue is recognized over the term of the sponsorship agreement in line with the performance obligations included within the contract and based on the sponsorship benefits enjoyed by the individual sponsor. In instances where the sponsorship rights remain the same over the duration of the contract, revenue is recognized as performance obligations are satisfied evenly over time (i.e. on a straight-line basis).
The minimum guarantee payable by adidas over the term of our agreement with them is equal to £750 million, subject to certain adjustments. Payments due in a particular year may increase if our men’s first team wins certain competitions or decrease if our men’s first team fails to participate in the Champions League for two or more consecutive seasons, with the reduction being 30% of the applicable payment for the year in which the second or other consecutive season of non-participation falls. In the event of a reduction in any year due to the failure to participate in the Champions League for two or more consecutive seasons, the remaining payments revert back to the original terms upon the men’s first team participating again in the Champions League. Any increase or decrease in a particular year would have the effect of increasing or decreasing the minimum guarantee amount of £750 million payable over the term of the agreement. A critical estimate in the current and future financial years therefore will be management’s assessment as to whether or not our men’s first team is likely to fail to participate in the Champions League for two or more consecutive seasons during the term of the agreement. Such assessments of future participation may differ from actual participation, which could result in a difference in the revenue recognized in a given year.
Broadcasting and Matchday
For our accounting policies relating to Broadcasting revenue and Matchday revenue, which management does not consider to involve critical estimates and judgments, see Notes 4.3(ii) and (iii) to our audited consolidated financial statements as of 30 June 2022 and 2021 and for the years ended 30 June 2022, 2021 and 2020 included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Fair value of intangible assets—registrations
The costs associated with the acquisition of players’ and key football management staff registrations are capitalized as intangible assets at the fair value of the consideration payable, including an estimate of
75

the fair value of any contingent consideration. Subsequent reassessments of the amount of contingent consideration payable are also included in the cost of the individual’s registration. The estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration payable requires management to assess the likelihood of specific performance conditions being met which would trigger the payment of the contingent consideration such as the number of player appearances. This assessment is carried out on an individual basis. Costs associated with the acquisition of players’ and key football management staff registrations include transfer fees, Premier League levy fees, agents’ fees and other directly attributable costs. These costs are amortized over the period covered by the individual’s contract. To the extent that an individual’s contract is extended, the remaining book value is amortized over the remaining revised contract life. See “B. Liquidity and Capital Resources—Off Balance Sheet Arrangements”.
Recognition of deferred tax assets We recognize deferred tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the associated deductions
will be available for use against future profits and that there will be sufficient future taxable profit available against which the temporary differences can be utilized, provided the asset can be reliably quantified. In estimating future taxable profit, management use “base case” approved forecasts which incorporate a number of assumptions, including a prudent level of future uncontracted revenue in the forecast period. In arriving at a judgment in relation to the recognition of deferred tax assets, management considers the regulations applicable to tax and advice on their interpretation. Future taxable income may be higher or lower than estimates made when determining whether it is appropriate to record a tax asset and the amount to be recorded. Furthermore, changes in the legislative framework or applicable tax case law may result in management reassessing the recognition of deferred tax assets in future periods.
Recognition of tax related provisions The Group is subject to a number of ongoing player related tax enquiries with HMRC, and management
regularly estimates the expected amounts payable as a result of these enquiries. Provisions are recognized based on management’s best estimate at the end of the reporting period of the probable future cash flows required to settle future liabilities which by their nature are uncertain. Management considers both the facts and evidence of each case on an individual basis, combined with our knowledge and experience in similar matters in estimating the value of these provisions. These provisions may change over time as a result of developments in the enquiries, additional evidence, or changes in precedent from other similar cases in the industry. The timing of these expected outflows is also by its nature uncertain and therefore a reliable estimate of its expected timing cannot be made.

Arrangements or Understandings
None of our executive officers or directors have any arrangement or understanding with our principal shareholders, customers, suppliers or other persons pursuant to which such executive officer or director was selected as an executive officer or director.
B. COMPENSATION
We set out below the amount of compensation paid and benefits in kind provided by us or our subsidiaries to our directors and members of the executive management for services in all capacities to our Company or our subsidiaries for the 2021 fiscal year, as well as the amount contributed by our Company or our subsidiaries to retirement benefit plans for our directors and members of the executive management board.

The total amount of compensation (including share-based payments) paid or payable and benefits in kind provided to the members of our board of directors and our executive management employees for the fiscal year 2022 was £7,185,000. We do not currently maintain any bonus or profit-sharing plan for the benefit of the members of our executive management; however, certain members of our executive management are eligible to receive annual bonuses (including share-based awards) pursuant to the terms of their service agreements.

79

Employment or Service Agreements
We have entered into written employment or service agreements with each of the members of our executive management, which agreements provide, among other things, for benefits upon a termination of employment. In order to align the interests of our executive management with our shareholders, members of our executive management are eligible to receive annual share-based awards (or cash and share-based awards) pursuant to our 2012 Equity Incentive Award Plan (the “Equity Plan”). The amount of the awards will generally be subject to the discretion of our board of directors and our remuneration committee. In order to encourage retention, the awards are eligible to become vested over a multi-year period following the date of grant. In connection with their receipt of the awards, each member of our executive management will agree to hold a minimum of that number of Class A ordinary shares with a value equal to such member’s annual salary for so long as such member is employed by us.
We have not entered into written employment or service agreements with our outside directors, including any member of the Glazer family. However, we may in the future enter into employment or services agreements with such individuals, the terms of which may provide for, among other things, cash or equity based compensation and benefits.

Share-Based Compensation Awards
We currently have one share-based compensation award plan, namely the 2012 Equity Incentive Award Plan, established in 2012 (the “Equity Plan”).

The Equity Plan

The principal purpose of the Equity Plan is to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and non-employee directors through the granting of share-based and cash-based compensation awards. The principal features of the Equity Plan are summarized below.

During the year ended 30 June 2022, certain directors and members of executive management were awarded Class A ordinary shares, pursuant to the Equity Plan. These shares are subject to varying vesting schedules over a multi-year period. The fair value of these shares was the quoted market price on the date of award. Details of the share awards outstanding and therefore potentially issuable as new shares are as follows:

Outstanding at beginning of the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Awarded during the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Vested during the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Forfeited during the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Outstanding at the end of the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Number of Class A ordinary shares
199,062 98,888 (67,659) (38,240) 192,051

The fair value of shares awarded during the year was $10.59 (£8.72) per share.

Share reserve
Under the Equity Plan, 16,000,000 Class A ordinary shares are reserved for issuance pursuant to a variety of share-based compensation awards, including share options, share appreciation rights, or SARs, restricted share awards, restricted share unit awards, deferred share awards, deferred share unit awards, dividend equivalent awards, share payment awards and other share-based awards. Of these reserved shares, assuming the above outstanding share awards fully vest, 14,788,222 shares remain available for issuance as of 1 September 2022.

Administration
The remuneration committee of our board of directors (or other committee as our board of directors may appoint) administers the Equity Plan unless our board of directors assumes authority for administration.

80

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Plan, the administrator has the authority to select the persons to whom awards are to be made, determines the types of awards to be granted, the number of shares to be subject to awards and the terms and conditions of awards, and makes all other determinations and can take all other actions necessary or advisable for the administration of the Equity Plan. The administrator is also authorized to adopt, amend or rescind rules relating to the administration of the Equity Plan. Our board of directors has the authority at all times to remove the remuneration committee (or other applicable committee) as the administrator and reinstate itself as the authority to administer the Equity Plan.
Eligibility
The Equity Plan provides that share options, share appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted shares and all other awards may be granted to individuals who will then be our non-employee directors, officers, employees or consultants or the non-employee directors, officers, employees or consultants of certain of our subsidiaries.
Awards
The Equity Plan provides that the administrator may grant or issue share options, SARs, restricted shares, restricted share units, deferred shares, deferred share units, dividend equivalents, share payments and other share-based awards, or any combination thereof. Each award will be set forth in a separate agreement with the person receiving the award and will indicate the type, terms and conditions of the award.
• Share Options provide for the right to purchase Class A ordinary shares at a specified price, and usually will become exercisable (at the discretion of the administrator) in one or more installments after the grant date, subject to the participant’s continued employment or service with us and/or subject to the satisfaction of corporate performance targets and/or individual performance targets established by the administrator.
• Restricted Shares may be granted to any eligible individual selected by the administrator and are made subject to such restrictions as may be determined by the administrator. Restricted shares, typically, are forfeited for no consideration or repurchased by us at the original purchase price (if applicable) if the conditions or restrictions on vesting are not met. The Equity Plan provides that restricted shares generally may not be sold or otherwise transferred until the applicable restrictions are removed or expire. Recipients of restricted shares, unlike recipients of share options, have voting rights and have the right to receive dividends, if any, prior to the time when the restrictions lapse; however, extraordinary dividends will generally be placed in escrow, and will not be released until the restrictions are removed or expire.
• Restricted Share Units may be awarded to any eligible individual selected by the administrator, typically without payment of consideration, but subject to vesting conditions based on continued employment or service or on performance criteria established by the administrator. The Equity Plan provides that, like restricted shares, restricted share units may not be sold, or otherwise transferred or hypothecated, until vesting conditions are removed or expire. Unlike restricted shares, Class A ordinary shares underlying restricted share units are not issued until the restricted share units have vested, and recipients of restricted share units generally have no voting or dividend rights prior to the time when vesting conditions are satisfied and the Class A ordinary shares are issued.
• Deferred Share Awards represent the right to receive Class A ordinary shares on a future date. The Equity Plan provides that deferred shares may not be sold or otherwise hypothecated or transferred until issued. Deferred shares are not issued until the deferred share award has vested, and recipients of deferred shares generally have no voting or dividend rights prior to the time when the vesting conditions are satisfied and the Class A ordinary shares are issued. Deferred share awards generally will be forfeited, and the underlying Class A ordinary shares of deferred shares will not be issued, if the applicable vesting conditions and other restrictions are not met.
• Deferred Share Unit Awards may be awarded to any eligible individual selected by the administrator, typically without payment of consideration, but subject to vesting conditions based on continued employment or service or on performance criteria established by the administrator. Each deferred share unit award entitles the holder thereof to receive one share of our Class A ordinary shares on the
81

date the deferred share unit becomes vested or upon a specified settlement date thereafter. The Equity Plan provides that, like deferred shares, deferred share units may not be sold or otherwise hypothecated or transferred until vesting conditions are removed or expire. Unlike deferred shares, deferred share units may provide that Class A ordinary shares in respect of underlying deferred share units will not be issued until a specified date or event following the vesting date. Recipients of deferred share units generally have no voting or dividend rights prior to the time when the vesting conditions are satisfied and the Class A ordinary shares underlying the award have been issued to the holder.
• Share Appreciation Rights, or SARs, may be granted in the administrator’s discretion separately or in connection with share options or other awards. SARs granted in connection with share options or other awards typically provide for payments to the holder based upon increases in the price of our Class A ordinary shares over a set exercise price. There are no restrictions specified in the Equity Plan on the exercise of SARs or the amount of gain realizable therefrom, although the Equity Plan provides that restrictions may be imposed by the administrator in the SAR agreements. SARs under the Equity Plan may be settled in cash or Class A ordinary shares, or in a combination of both, at the election of the administrator.
• Dividend Equivalents represent the value of the dividends, if any, per Class A ordinary share paid by us, calculated with reference to the number of Class A ordinary shares covered by the award. The Equity Plan provides that dividend equivalents may be settled in cash or Class A ordinary shares and at such times as determined by the administrator.
• Share Payments are payments made to employees, consultants or non-employee directors in the form of Class A ordinary shares or an option or other right to purchase Class A ordinary shares. Share payments may be made as part of a bonus, deferred compensation or other arrangement and may be subject to a vesting schedule, including vesting upon the attainment of performance criteria, in which case the share payment will not be made until the vesting criteria have been satisfied. Share payments may be made in lieu of cash compensation that would otherwise be payable to the employee, consultant or non-employee director or share payments may be made as a bonus payment in addition to compensation otherwise payable to such individuals.
Change in control
The Equity Plan provides that the administrator may, in its discretion, provide that awards issued under the Equity Plan are subject to acceleration, cash-out, termination, assumption, substitution or conversion of such awards in the event of a change in control or certain other unusual or nonrecurring events or transactions. In addition, the administrator also has complete discretion to structure one or more awards under the Equity Plan to provide that such awards become vested and exercisable or payable on an accelerated basis in the event such awards are assumed or replaced with equivalent awards but the individual’s service with us or the acquiring entity is subsequently terminated within a designated period following the change in control event. A change in control event under the Equity Plan is generally defined as a merger, consolidation, reorganization or business combination in which we are involved, directly or indirectly (other than a merger, consolidation, reorganization or business combination which results in our outstanding voting securities immediately before the transaction continuing to represent a majority of the voting power of the acquiring company’s outstanding voting securities) after which a person or group (other than our existing equity-holders) beneficially owns more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the surviving entity immediately after the transaction, or the sale, exchange or transfer of all or substantially all of our assets.
Adjustments of awards
In the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or exchange of shares, merger, consolidation, spin-off, recapitalization, distribution of our assets to shareholders (other than normal cash dividends) or any other corporate event affecting the number of outstanding Class A ordinary shares in our capital or the share price of our Class A ordinary shares that would require adjustments to the Equity Plan or any awards under the Equity Plan in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of the potential benefits intended to be made available thereunder, the Equity Plan provides that the administrator may make equitable
82

adjustments, as determined in its discretion, to the aggregate number and type of shares subject to the Equity Plan, the number and kind of shares subject to outstanding awards and the terms and conditions of outstanding awards (including, without limitation, any applicable performance targets or criteria with respect to such awards), and the grant or exercise price per share of any outstanding awards under the Equity Plan.
Amendment and termination
The Equity Plan provides that our board of directors or the remuneration committee (with the approval of the board of directors) may terminate, amend or modify the Equity Plan at any time and from time to time. However, the Equity Plan generally requires us to obtain shareholder approval to the extent required by applicable law, rule or regulation (including any applicable stock exchange law), including in connection with any amendments to increase the number of shares available under the Equity Plan (other than in connection with certain corporate events, as described above).
Securities laws
The Equity Plan is designed to comply with all applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and, to the extent applicable, any and all regulations and rules promulgated by the SEC thereunder. The Equity Plan is administered, and stock options will be granted and may be exercised, only in such a manner as to conform to such laws, rules and regulations. On 13 August 2012, we filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 covering Class A ordinary shares issuable under the Equity Plan.
UK Subplan
Our board of directors approved the 2012 UK Company Share Option UK Sub-Plan on 10 September 2013. This is a sub-plan to the Equity Plan which allows for the grant of stock options in a tax efficient manner to employees who are UK residents. It derives its powers and authority from the Equity Plan and does not create any enhanced or additional rights. This sub-plan does not increase the share reserve under the Equity Plan.
C. BOARD PRACTICES
Board of directors
We currently have 12 directors on our board of directors, three of whom have been determined by the board of directors to qualify as “independent” pursuant to rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Any director on our board may be removed by way of an ordinary resolution of shareholders or by our shareholders holding a majority of the voting power of our outstanding ordinary shares by notice in writing to the Company. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that each director elected at a general meeting shall be elected to hold office for a one-year term and until the election of their respective successors in office or their earlier death, resignation or removal. Any vacancies on our board of directors or additions to the existing board of directors can be filled by the board of directors or by our shareholders holding a majority of the voting power of our outstanding ordinary shares by notice in writing to the Company. For more information on the length of time each director has served, see “Item 6.A. Directors and Senior Management.”
We have entered into written employment or service agreements with certain of the members of our board of directors, which agreements provide, amongst other things, for benefits upon termination of employment. We have not entered into written employment or service agreements with our outside directors, including any member of the Glazer family.
Committees of the Board of directors and Corporate Governance
Our board of directors has established an audit committee and a remuneration committee. The composition and responsibilities of each committee are described below. Members serve on these committees until their resignation or until otherwise determined by our board of directors. In the future, our board of directors may establish other committees, as it deems appropriate, to assist with its responsibilities.
83

Audit committee
Our audit committee consists of Messrs. John Hooks, Robert Leitão and Manu Sawhney. Our board of directors determined that each of Messrs. John Hooks, Robert Leitão and Manu Sawhney is financially literate and satisfies the “independence” requirements set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. Mr. Robert Leitão acts as chairman of our audit committee and has been determined by the board of directors to qualify as an audit committee financial expert as set forth under the applicable rules of the Exchange Act. A copy of our audit committee charter is available on our website at https://ir.manutd.com/.

B. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
We have entered into employment or service agreements with members of executive management. Information regarding these agreements may be found in this Annual Report under Item 6. “Directors,
88

Senior Management and Employees—B. Compensation” and is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, members of management have received equity compensation. See also Note 7.2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information about compensation paid or payable to key management for services, which is incorporated herein by reference.
There have been no other related party transactions since the beginning of our last full fiscal year that began on 1 July 2021 through the date of this Annual Report.
ITEM 8. FINANCIAL INFORMATION
A. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Consolidated Financial Statements
See “Item 18. Financial Statements.”
Legal and Arbitration Proceedings
There have been no governmental, judicial or arbitration proceedings, including those relating to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings and those involving any third party, (including any such proceedings which are pending or threatened of which we are aware) during the period between 1 July 2021 and the date of this Annual Report which may have, or have had in the recent past, significant effects on our financial position and profitability.
Dividend Policy
In fiscal year 2022, we paid cash dividends on our Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares of $0.09 per share on 30 July 2021, 7 January 2022 and 24 June 2022. We currently intend to continue paying regular semi-annual cash dividends on our Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares of $0.09 per share from our operating cash flows. The declaration and payment of any future dividends, however, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors or a committee thereof based on its consideration of numerous factors, including our operating results, financial condition and anticipated capital requirements, including the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on such items, in addition to the various other considerations discussed below.
If we do pay a cash dividend on our Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares in the future, we will pay such dividend out of our profits or share premium (subject to solvency requirements) as permitted under Cayman Islands law. Our board of directors has complete discretion regarding the declaration and payment of dividends, and the holders of our Class B ordinary shares will be able to influence our dividend policy.
The decision by our board of directors (or a committee thereof) to declare and pay dividends in the future and the amount of any future dividend payments we may make will depend on, among other factors, our strategy, future earnings, financial condition, cash flow, working capital requirements, capital expenditures and applicable provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Any profits or share premium we declare as dividends will not be available to be reinvested in our operations. Moreover, we are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, we are dependent upon cash dividends, distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to make dividend payments, and the terms of our subsidiaries’ debt and other agreements restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividends or other distributions to us. Specifically, pursuant to our revolving facilities, our secured term loan facility and the note purchase agreement governing our senior secured notes, there are restrictions on our subsidiaries’ ability to distribute dividends to us, and dividend distributions by our subsidiaries are the principal means by which we would have the necessary funds to pay dividends on our Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares for the foreseeable future. See “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—B. Liquidity and Capital Resources—Indebtedness.” As a consequence of these limitations and restrictions, we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce or eliminate, the payment of dividends on our Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares.
89

Any dividends we declare in the future on our ordinary shares will be in respect of both our Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares, and will be distributed such that a holder of one of our Class B ordinary shares will receive the same amount of the dividends that are received by a holder of one of our Class A ordinary shares. We will not declare any dividend with respect to the Class A ordinary shares without declaring a dividend on the Class B ordinary shares, and vice versa.
B. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
