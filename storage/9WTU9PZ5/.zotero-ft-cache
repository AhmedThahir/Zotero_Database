The Dolores model will make a good prediction when matching between a and b. With the aid of historical evidence, it is also possible to predict if the opponent's team is not involved in the game. Predictive error is 0.94 per cent higher and 116.78 per cent lower than the bottom participant. Dolores created 20% + ROI on the basis of approximately seven seasons of the English Premier League.
In [16] they suggested that in nearly two-thirds of situations, the winner of the English county's twenty cricket games could be expected. The classification methods used are Naïve Bayes Logistic regression, random forest and gradient enhanced tress. This classification the most effective one is naive Bayes. At last comparison was done in betting odds benchmarks and naïve Bayes player naive Bayes performance was way better than the old benchmarks.
In [17] they proposed using machine learning classifier we can predict the outcome of Dutch football. There are some machine learning algorithms are used generalized boost model (GBM) naïve Bayes K-nearest neighbor (KNN). They have used multiple data mining techniques for analysis and prediction. At last the generalized boost model (GBM) made an accuracy of 82.12% correctly. GBM often produce predictive accuracy that cannot be beaten.
In [18] Work is a system that predicts the winner in the sports game. They used greedy logic, data acquisition, data processing, and predictive decision-making approaches. The outcome can differ if the data features are changed. The result indicates that the best classifier is 5 percent more accurate than the referent classifier, which favors the team with a better ranking.
In [19] they suggested a comparison between the result-based on ratings and the goal-based ODM (offense defense model). They applied models to the open national soccer database. They considered as covariates all the combination of result-and globally dependent regression with rating and goal-based ODM rating difference. If it was found that Elo based ordered logit model outperforms all the other models. Including a more nuanced literary model.
In [20] they proposed using machine learning player valuation can be done in European football. Data mining is used. This paper shows that it compares and contrasts the strengths of players, the best statistical abilities in European football. This paper includes the Q function and the effect of a deep reinforcement learning model on the assessment of the player's behavior. This minimized model analyzes players by characterizing the value and in part dependency story. Valuation accuracy F1 top 10 percent, F1 top 25 percent, F1 top 50 percent.
In [21] they Suggested use of long-term memory recurring neural network prediction can be achieved at a glance to train a soccer player. The problem they addressed and they tackled that with a solution. The data has been collected using PMSys system. The dilemma of deriving peaks in the ability of a soccer player to succeed from a subjective self-reported wellness they train recurrent neural networks with long-term memory using data from two professional soccer teams. Their model predicts with precision positive and negative peaks and recalls over 90 percent.
In [22] they proposed two fundamental case of sport analysis one is team performance and player performance prediction. They followed two approaches. And first approach gave them a satisfactory result. And the second approach for team performance gave a remarkable result. They used machine learning algorithms for this. Finally SVM with polynomial kernel observed clearly and achieved a good result in every league.
In [23] they proposed that based on internet information results will be forecasted in football matches. They used some methods based on the weighted sum of indicators, method based on poison distribution, method based on forecasting rules. Method based on weighted sum of indicators predicts match result accuracy is 77.6%. The poison distribution uses another sets and predict match accuracy is 83.5%. Method based on rules of forecasting predict match accuracy of 70.4%. They propose that accuracy is depend upon the forecasting factors. Better the forecasting factor choice better the accuracy.
In [24] they suggested that a prediction could be made to find the winning team using decision tree. And decision tree algorithm is so simple to understand it and it is primarily used for data interpretation and forecasting. Their experiment showed that two teams were playing in recent matches. Considering both the home and the field. The highest accuracy is 57.7%.

football. Based on their performance and popularity and skills players will be recruited. Linear combination of parameters and the input vector will be incredibly easy to compute.

In [26] they suggested a novel way of forecasting a soccer match. In this paper, a novel method was developed to forecast soccer matches. Here they demonstrate an alternative sources for curated data. Which can be done through very intensive data collection. This will help the prediction process and result will be very accurate. The main challenge of machine learning project is to collect data by this approach collecting the data will be easy and effective.

In [27] they proposed an open international soccer database for machine learning. Collecting data will be a difficult part in machine learning projects. The more clear data you collect the more accuracy will be appeared. For collecting good data they created a data base and stored about 52 leagues from 35 countries. And also they predicted the result.

In [28] they suggested using Machine Learning to predict football league winners of bookies. Methods used Bayesian Learning, Lazy Learning, Decision Tree, intelligent machine architecture. The result obtained is accurate and established. Finally, it can be concluded that the study requires more practical data and adequate expertise to make the model developed more advanced and accurate.

In [29] using machine learning techniques predicting football. Problem is while predicting the outcome the factors become difficult in processing it so for that they developed a software solution in order to try and solve this problem the solution will be an optimized one. The result shows a satisfactory capability of prediction which I superior to one of the reference method. The accuracy is around 60%.

In [30] they proposed player pairs valuation in ice hockey. This paper covers all about finding the players chemistry level with their teammates in the match. And predicting the best player’s pairs by using data mining analysis and Q function. From coaches data will be collected mainly and they also did hypothesize. Innovative approach has done.
