Concave Key Wells and Thumb Keys

Hands and fingers are placed in a natural, relaxed position to shorten key-reach and reduce over-extension.

Use stronger thumbs rather than weaker pinkies to access heavily used keys like Space, Backspace, and Enter.
	
20 Degree Tenting and Compact Design

Tenting elevates the thumb side of the hand to reduce forearm pronation caused by flat keyboards.

Tenkeyless layout with embedded keypad results in a smaller footprint for closer mouse placement.
	
Fixed Split and Vertical Keys

Hands are positioned at shoulder-width to keep wrists straight and reduce ulnar deviation.

Orthogonal key arrangement mirrors the natural motion of your fingers to increase speed and comfort.
	
Palm Supports and Sculpted Home Row

Integrated palm supports and cushioned palm pads promote neutral wrist position reducing harmful wrist extension.

Find the home row without taking your eyes off the screen with sculpted home row keycaps.

5.0 out of 5 stars Just plain WOW!
Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2023
Color: Black Verified Purchase
BACKGROUND: I have used Macs since 1986 and, therefore, many of their keyboards. I have also tried several other brands over the years - but none can compare to the ease of typing on my Kinesis, which I have used for 15 years. I don't remember when I got the first one, but the original keyboard was the white model, and, over the years, it has gradually turned a dull yellow.
The first one took a little time to get used to it, but it was/is fantastic once I did. I'm 6' 1" and broad-shouldered, so I had to squinch my arms together and bend my wrists. And I used to wear wrist braces for carpal tunnel issues. After using the Kinesis for a while, I stopped wearing the braces and have not had wrist issues for a loooonnnnggg time. :-) Also, I can touch type on the Kinesis keyboards. I say boards because this purchase was my 4th one: upgrading the office keyboard, home, and 2nd home.

In December, after waiting for six weeks, I was excited to try one of the new 360 models - and frankly LOVED both the flexibility of adjusting each hand's key's angle and elevations together with the feel of the keys!
But unfortunately, despite all of Tyler Sullivan's (in their tech support department) efforts, I could not conquer the programming skills needed to make it operate as a Mac keyboard. His efforts were much appreciated, but although I have used Macs for all these years, I have never done any coding. It was literally Greek to me!

Since I liked the keys on the 360, I decided to try the Advantage 2 model to see how it feels.
It arrived yesterday. The new model keys are so silent and touch-friendly. A tiny detail - the home keys are slightly more cupped, so one's fingertips tell you instantly that they are “home.” :-)
Overall: WOW!
Nice!
Smooth!
And Quiet.
Worth updating! (Even without my carpal tunnel issue, I’d update just for the superior feel and quieter typing!)
And consider that the A2 is one-half the cost of the 360 (which I had just returned), so there is that.

And finally, FYI - I will likely upgrade the other two keyboards. Considering the extra cost of replacing two more keyboards tells you how much I like the A-2 model.

Nonetheless, I will wait awhile with my fingers crossed - yep - it is challenging to type that way ;-) I am hoping that, once the original demand for the 360 has been caught up, Kinesis will consider making the 360 available ready to use as a Mac Keyboard!

KINESIS, ARE YOU LISTENING?

So, I strongly recommend you give their technology a try. I hope you find it as appealing as I do.

5.0 out of 5 stars The Keyboard Of The Gods
Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2022
Color: Black Verified Purchase
It's just the best. It's smooth. It's comfortable. It's flexible. It's a 10-star product. It does take some time to get used to, but it is SO worth it. The first day is absolutely painful. Take my advice and power through the cramp that this keyboard will put in your brain. A lot of mistakes will be made, but having the backspace, control, delete, and enter keys right by your thumbs will offset all of that. You'll be gaining speed before you know it.

For me, the transition to this layout was relatively fast, but I've spent my life typing like a fish out of water. I have small hands, and every keyboard I've ever owned has been awkward, especially all those keys that rely on pinky-reaches. I spent more time backspacing than typing. Keyboards never fit, and I didn't realize how bad it was until I got used to this one and (eventually) experienced what it was like to type smoothly and without errors for the first time ever. Given that, it only took me about three days to adjust. I know of others didn't hit their groove for a month or so. It's still worth the learning curve, in my opinion, no matter how big that curve may be.

Some observations:

1. The imbedded 10-key is not very usable IMO. I ended up attaching an old smartphone with a keypad app to the big space between the keyboard's recessed typing wells. It's easy to use and also provides a mouse touchpad in addition to being a keypad. (hey Kenesis, this would be a nice built-in feature for future models)

2. This keyboard case shows every fingerprint, every palm print, and every little touch. Something as simple as hand lotion from two hours ago can make this board look like its user is a total greaseball.

3. The interface to remap keys is not as user-friendly as it looks, at least at first. There are instructions and even a video available, but they do not seem geared toward all learning styles. That might be fine for most users, and even I (beginner-computer-geekery level) could eventually figure it out.

4. It has the strangest little phone plug sticking out of the back. My understanding is this is for users who wish to run a foot pedal through the keyboard (instead of directly to a computer). This would be an awesome option, but most foot pedals these days have USB plugs, not something Meemaw would use to plug a land line into the wall. On a related note, it would be nice if Kinesis brought their line of foot pedals into the USB world as well, because transcriptionists around the world are looking for alternatives to their currently limited foot pedal options.

5. I think the price is worth the sheer comfort of this keyboard, but I also think it might be nice for buyers to have the option to pay less for a scaled-back model. I don't need macro scripting, I can't use the embedded 10-key, the foot pedal plug is oddly archaic, and the sad reality is that this keyboard is going to ruin me for other keyboards and probably slow me down significantly when I need to work on other devices. The purchase price does seem a bit high for someone who does not need all of its features. Again, it's still very, very much worth the sheer comfort.

If you're still reading along, this really is a gem of a keyboard, and I absolutely recommend it. I know when I was trying to decide if the price was worth the leap, I had some doubts. Hopefully these little bits will help you know what it's like to make that leap and settle in with this wonderful and well-thought little keyboard.

ETA: so this little beast has been with me for nearly a year, and I have to say it is extremely durable. I move my keyboard around a lot, and I drop this thing on the floor at least 3x a week. So far, nothing is rattling, nothing is dented, and nothing is misfiring. It can really take a licking.

3.0 out of 5 stars Great keyboard, but can we have more options?
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on October 21, 2020
Color: Black Verified Purchase
I got the silent red version. First of all, my review is by no means saying this is a bad keyboard. To be honest, this is a great keyboard, but at this price tag people naturally have very high expectations. I will just comment on things that are kind of unexpected to me.

Surprises:
The keypad switch is a BIG undersell! The product description just says the keypad key turns your right key well into a numpad, but it actually activates a whole new second layer, and you can customise all keys on this layer as well! I cannot imagine that Kinesis just brands this as "hey, in case you still need the numpad, you can find it here" instead of "you have a whole secondary layer that you can customise, and we just happen to preset the numpad on some keys for you". I programmed the backspace key into second layer shift (my CapsLock works as backspace anyway) and as a Vim user, I programmed HJKL as arrow keys so I don't need to reach the actual arrow keys. Also, I mapped operators (-, =, [, ]) to UIOP which is really efficient. Let's be honest, these keys are awkward to reach, especially when coding with this keyboard, but with a second layer, it is much more efficient than you think. Note that you can change almost any key to keypad shift or keypad toggle to activate the second layer.

Now about the two missing stars:
This keyboard is designed for medium to large hands. My right pinky had trouble reaching the P key, and if I moved my hand up to reach it, then my right thumb would be at the upper bit of the space key. Those large keys (space, enter, backspace, delete) don't have stabilisers so it can be hard to actuate if you are not pressing right in the middle. Of course, after some getting used to this is not much of a problem, but for me, it would be ideal if the pinky column is further down, and the thumb cluster is moved up a bit.

Cherry silent red switches. I am using it in an office environment and MX brown is simply too loud. It is very quiet for sure, not louder than rubber domes and my colleague can just take a nap next to me without complaining. BUT, silent reds are very scratchy. I don't have a problem with it being mushy since I use O-rings on my other keyboards and this level of mushiness is quite acceptable, but silent reds are probably the most scratchy in all the switches I used. I have keyboards with Gateron and Outemu reds and they feel much smoother. I really do hope Kinesis can give us more options on switches. Cherry may have good browns, but in my opinion they simply don't produce the best reds and blues.

5.0 out of 5 stars The best keyboard I have even had.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on February 15, 2022
Color: Black Verified Purchase
I have bought the Kinesis Advantage 2 Quiet LF and I also own a Kinesis Advantage Pro with brown keys.
The linear switches are in my opinion better suited for this keyboard.
I am a heavy CAD user, AutoCAD, Microstation, C3D, OpenRoads, scripting, programming, etc. I am also suffering from RSI and I noticed a vast improvement since using this keyboard.
Since I've got it, I switched to a modified Dvorak layout and found it more comfortable.
This keyboard is a tool, and like any tool it requires time to adapt and configure, there is a learning curve and some frustration involved, but once getting used to it one can work longer and less stressful.
I highly recommend getting a foot pedal, I have a hacked version as Amazon does not have the Kinesis one in stock and importing one to the UK is prohibitive. The foot pedal allows access to a modified layout on the fly.
There are enough detailed reviews of this keyboard on the internet so I won't repeat that here.
One overlooked feature is the included speaker, I was a hard hitter and always bottomed out, since turning it on helped me to be a "softer" typist.
Use the ASCII files to configure the keyboard and have them saved somewhere safe.
In CAD the use is limited without proper configuration, this keyboard is great for typing but in CAD we have one hand on the keyboard and one on the mouse, the split layout of this keyboard is less CAD friendly unless tuned for application. Read the manual, it is mandatory to be able to get the maximum of this tool.
What I do not like is the function row keys, they could use normal switches since getting there requires a bit of move, in CAD and programming we use these extensively and the small ones are hard to hit. Use of a pedal allows re-mapping to the number keys, but on some occasions it requires the use of the dedicated ones.
It is big and hollow and sometimes has echo, especially when working from home in a quiet room.
I cannot use it with my Contour Rollermouse, due to size of both, i have to hack something together to get them to play together.
Expensive, but any mechanical keyboard is nowadays, if it is ergonomic add some extra. Kinesis has a great customer support, always happy to help.
Going back to a laptop keyboard while travelling is annoying at least.
If you care about you hands and need them on a keyboard get one and get used to it.

Definitely helped my carpal tunnel pain. Maybe another keyboard also would've helped, but I can't think of one that could've done as good a job as this one.

The quiet keys were worth it in my opinion. They are indeed quiet, but they also actually feel better than my old, non-quiet mechanical keyboard, especially for quick repeated key presses. Perhaps the Kinesis clicky switches feel even better though, who knows.

The best part for me was learning how easy it is to set up a new layout or macro, with the app. I'd say the worst thing about the KA2 is the fact that I have medium-to-small size hands and so reachability isn't quite perfect. I'd give the reachability a score of 87/100 - it's good, but it would be nice if they released, for example, 3 different sizes of keyboard (?).

Anyway, it's a huge improvement from using a normal keyboard. And I don't think it's hard to learn at all. You get such an advantage from having Space and Backspace on your thumbs - even if you keep making mistakes at the start you can instantly backspace them away without hassle.
In fact, I didn't use to touch type before this keyboard, but... the layout, the thumb clusters, the spacing and most of all the straight matrix of keys make it so easy to learn that I thought why not? I even ended up creating a completely custom layout, and I'd say it only took about a week or two before I managed to get a passable speed (just under 40wpm). I mean, I'm not that fast, even now, but it's not like it's the keyboard that slows me down. The important thing is that it's fun and pain-free, so I don't have to worry about speed anyway!

5.0 out of 5 stars Should have gotten it sooner

I have postoponed getting this keyboard a lot because of the price, but I should have gotten it sooner.
It has saved my career and well being.
I used to need to wear an orthosis brace at night and needed to stop working because my wrist was hurting so bad.
Now, while the discomfort is not completely gone, this makes a world of difference.
I recommend fighting through the break in period and also customizing it to your preferences.
The most important step, in my opinion, is to change the keys to your liking. My setup looks nothing like what the default is for the pecial keys.
Also, make heavy use of the macros to get rid of those weird hand movements.

The plastic quality is not the best but that hardly matters when it does what it's supposed to do well.
