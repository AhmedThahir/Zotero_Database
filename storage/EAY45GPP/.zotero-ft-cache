DHS S&T Commercialization Office
The DHS Science and Technology (S&T) Commercialization efforts are headed by the Chief Commercialization Officer (CCO), a position created in August 2007 within the Transition Office in S&T. The mission of the Commercialization Office is to develop and execute programs and processes that identify, evaluate and commercialize technology through the development of widely distributed products and/or services that meet the operational requirements of the Department of Homeland Security’s Operating Components, First Responder community and other Department stakeholders when required. A primary function of the Commercialization Office is developing and managing S&T’s outreach effort with the private sector to establish and foster mutually beneficial working relationships leading to the fielding of technology-based products and services to secure the nation. In order to achieve its mission, the Commercialization Office has organized the following initiatives to gather, articulate, communicate and facilitate the development of products and services based upon detailed operational requirements received from DHS’ operating components and stakeholders:
Requirements Development Initiative – Efforts that enable the detailed articulation of operational requirements across the Department are implemented to ensure the accurate and timely development and deployment of products and services to aid in the implementation of the mission-critical objectives of the Operating Components, First Responders and other DHS stakeholders.
Commercialization Process – A new “hybrid” commercialization model has been created that combines the best attributes of the well-known Acquisition and “pure” Commercialization models. This hybrid model begins with DHS needs assessment and results in widely distributed products and services for use by DHS and its wide range of stakeholders.
SECURE Program – An innovative public-private sector partnership based on DHS’s new commercialization model. DHS S&T conducts private sector outreach efforts to communicate DHS requirements along with potential available market information to create business case scenarios for possible private sector investment in technology and product development aligned to DHS needs.
S&T Private Sector Outreach – One of the key roles of the Chief Commercialization Officer is to act as a liaison with the private sector connecting DHS requirements and potential technology-based solutions offered by industry. Outreach efforts center on notifying the private sector about opportunities that exist for partnership to address the needs of the Department and its stakeholders. Several articles have been written about our Commercialization efforts. Outreach efforts are conducted through invited briefs to a number of venues reaching small, medium and large businesses. Efforts also extend to regularly meeting with minority, disadvantaged and HUB Zone groups as evidenced from our Private Sector Outreach Statistics.

Introduction
The purpose of this guide is simple and straightforward: to enable the reader to articulate detailed requirements or needs and effectively communicate them (either internally within DHS or externally to other Federal agencies or the private sector) through an Operational Requirements Document (ORD) vehicle. Often, we have heard expressions like “It all boils down to a lack of communications,” or “We’re not sure what you need,” or “DHS has been difficult to work with because they really don’t have a clear picture of their problems, needs or requirements.” We can remedy this situation by implementing some fundamental practices in a disciplined manner.
A well-written ORD can be an effective vehicle or tool to relay the needs of a given component, group or agency in an easily understood format to sedulously avoid the countless hours of time and other resources wasted speculating needs. Research conclusively shows that the foremost reason why programs or projects do not succeed is due to the lack of detailed requirements at the initiation of a program or project. Efforts invested up front to develop a clear understanding of the requirements pay dividends in the positive outcome of programs -- not to mention the savings in both time and money in corrective actions taken to get a program back on track (if it is even possible!).
We intend to make writing an ORD simple and easy. To that end, we have provided in this book an easy-to-follow ORD template, along with several real world examples of ORDs. In the numerous appendixes accompanying this book, you will find articles and briefings that provide additional context to the role that creating detailed operational requirements play in effective product realization. For your convenience, we have also included Appendix J, which contains the original Requirements Development Guide (April 2008) for those interested in a more detailed discussion on requirements development and product development life cycles.
If you have any questions or need any assistance – any at all – please feel free to contact Dr. Thomas A. Cellucci, DHS-S&T Chief Commercialization Officer at Thomas.Cellucci@dhs.gov.

Product Realization
If you think about it, there are numerous examples in our professional and private lives where the lack of communication or unclear terminology has created misunderstandings, problems and a myriad of other issues. As in any worthwhile pursuit, effective communication is critical in the cost-effective and efficient interactions between various parties seeking a mutually beneficial relationship or partnership.
At every step of product development, it is critical to understand and meet user needs. The Commercialization Office has created a Product Realization Chart that is a useful guide that shows the due diligence necessary for the productive development of products or services (See Appendix H). Product development is not a trivial effort; but with proper planning, tracking and communication, successful product development can yield measurable positive results and provide DHS operating components with resources necessary to carry out their mission-critical objectives to protect our country.
The initial phase of product realization is a mission needs assessment. This assessment should be conducted relative to the overall mission for a given organization. This exercise identifies capabilities needed to perform required functions, highlights deficiencies in a functional capability and documents the results of the analysis. Some of these capabilities may already be addressed with existing products, systems or services currently accessible by an organization. Additionally, a mission needs assessment serves to identify deficiencies in current and projected capabilities. In the event that current products are not able to address a particular capability; a capability gap exists. Briefly, capability gaps are defined by the difference between current operational capabilities and those necessary capabilities needed to perform mission-critical objectives that remain unsatisfied. Capability gaps must be listed in terms of an overall need to perform a specific task and should avoid explaining how that task should be achieved. See appendix G for further reading.
For example, faced with the problem of potential intruders to a sensitive facility, we might define the requirement as “build a wall” whereas the real requirement is “detect, thwart, and capture intruders.” Our wall might “thwart” intruders (or might not, if they’re adept at tunneling), but it would not detect them or facilitate their capture. In short, the solution would not solve the problem.
7

The robust capability gap to “detect, thwart, and capture intruders” includes no preconceived solutions and prompts us to analyze alternative conceptual solutions and choose the best.
One way to ensure that we are defining a problem, rather than a solution is to begin the statement of the requirement with the phrase “we need the capability to …” It’s nearly impossible to complete this sentence with a solution (“a wall”), and much easier to complete the sentence with a problem (“capability to detect intruders”). Capability gaps and requirements should address what a system should do, rather than how to do it. This approach is sometimes called capability-based planning. It is a very simple, yet powerful concept.
Properly defining clear and concise capability gaps is a necessary first step in product realization. This high-level understanding of a problem is a key part in the communication of needs. One may find that capability gaps are oftentimes common across multiple cross-sections of DHS operating components and supporting elements such as the first responder community and private sector critical infrastructure owner/operators. Discovering these commonalities is a fundamental aspect of the DHS S&T Capstone IPT Process, which seeks to reduce duplication of efforts and expedite product transition. See Appendix B for further information.
Why Requirements?
A requirement is an attribute of a product, service or system necessary to produce an outcome(s) that satisfies the needs of a person, group or organization. Requirements therefore define “the problem.” In contrast, “the solution” is defined by technical specifications.
Defining requirements is the process of determining what to make before making it. Requirements definition creates a method in which appropriate decisions about product or system functionality and performance can be made before investing the time and money to develop it. Understanding requirements early removes a great deal of guesswork in the planning stages and helps to ensure that the end-users and product developers are “on the same page.”
Requirements provide criteria against which solutions can be tested and evaluated. They offer detailed metrics that can be used to objectively measure a possible solution’s effectiveness, ensuring informed purchasing decisions on products, systems or services that achieve the stated operational goals. A detailed requirements analysis can uncover hidden requirements as well as discover common problems across programs and various DHS operating components. Detailed operational requirements will guide product development so that solutions specifications actively solve the stated problems.
We could save ourselves a lot of work if we jump straight to “the solution” without defining “the problem.” Why don’t we do that? Because if we take that shortcut we are
8

likely to find that our solution may not be the best choice among possible alternatives or, even worse we’re likely to find that our “solution” doesn’t even solve the problem!
Defining requirements and adhering to developing solutions to address those needs is often referred to as “requirements-pull.” In this situation, user requirements drive product development and guide the path forward as the requirements dictate. This is a powerful circumstance in which fulfilling requirements becomes the central focus of product development and no possible solution is disregarded given it facilitates
At the other extreme from the “requirements-pull”, approach is its opposite: “technology push.” Here we start with a solution (perhaps a new technology) and see what problems it might enable us to solve. The danger in this approach is to become enamored of “the solution” and neglect to ensure that it actually solves a problem. With technology push, it is likely that actual user requirements may be modified, or even ignored in order to “force-fit” the desired solution. A historical example was the product known as Picture Phone introduced (and discontinued) in the 1960s when the advance of telecommunications technology first made possible the transmission and display of video as well as voice. Picture Phone, which allowed telephone users to see each other during a call, was a technological success but a market disaster. It turned out that callers generally don’t want to be seen, as a bit of unbiased market analysis would have disclosed.
Technology push should not be ignored, but if the goal is successful transition to the field with acceptable risk, the technology being pushed must be compared with alternative solutions against a real set of user requirements.
Aside from assuring that the “solution” actually solves the “problem,” requirementsdriven design has a further advantage in that the requirements provide criteria against which a product’s successful development can be measured. Specifically, if the product was developed to address a set of quantified operational requirements, then its success is measured by Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) to validate that an end-user can use the product and achieve the stated operational goals.
Prior to OT&E, it is common practice to subject products to Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E). The purpose of DT&E is to verify that the product meets its technical specifications, which are the engineers’ interpretation of the operational requirements. Such DT&E does not obviate the need for OT&E, which validates that the engineers’ solution is not only technically successfully but also represents a successful interpretation of the end users’ needs, satisfying the original operational requirements (not just the technical specifications) when operated by representative users.
Often requirements are stated in terms of “threshold values” and “objective values,” where the “objective value” is the desired performance and the “threshold value” is the minimum acceptable performance. This formalism is useful in allowing stretch goals to be asserted without saddling the system development with unacceptable risk.
9

The Requirements Hierarchy and Traceability
To reiterate the definitions above, the documents that govern product realization include requirements, which define the problem, and specifications, which define the solution. Nevertheless, the hierarchy of requirements and specifications is more complex than that simple dichotomy, as depicted in Figure 1.
The hierarchy is divided into two domains, operational requirements and technical requirements, highlighted in yellow and blue in the figure, representing the “problem space” and the “solution space” respectively. The DHS Operating Component, representing the end users in the field (the operators), is responsible for all operational requirements, from the top-level mission requirements to the detailed system-level operational requirements. A system developer is responsible for translating the operational requirements into a system solution, documented in a hierarchy of technical specifications.

Requirements Hierarchy (TSA example)

High Level (qualitative

The Sponsor (representing the operators) develops operational requirements
consistent with organizational missions.

DHS Mission – Strategic Goals (“Prevent terrorist attacks”)

TSA Mission (“Protect traveling public”)

Capability Gap/Mission Needs Statement (“Prevent weapons aboard aircraft”)
Operational Requirement (“Detect firearms”)

Operational Requirements
(“The

Performance Requirement (“Metal detection & classification”)
Functional Specification (“Detect metal > 50 gm”)
Design Specification (“MTBF > 2000 hours”)
Material Specification (“Use type FR-4 epoxy resin”)

Technical Requirements
(“The

Low Level (Quantitativ
e)

The Program Manager and Acquisition / Engineering community develop technical
requirements and specifications.

Each lower-level requirement must be traceable to a higher-level requirement.
Figure 1. The requirements hierarchy

The highest-level type of technical “specification” is actually called a performance “requirement.” A performance requirement actually represents a bridge from operational requirements to the engineering interpretation of those requirements. Put another way, in the course of developing a new system it is necessary to transform the system operational requirements, which are stated from a given Operating Component’s perspective as required outcomes of system action, into a set of system performance requirements, which are stated in terms of engineering characteristics.
Working through the requirements hierarchy, requirements development is the process of decomposing the problems broadly outlined in the capability gaps gleaned from the mission needs assessment.

10

The requirements and specifications are described below, first those that define the problem and then those that define the solution:
• Problem Definition
o Mission Needs Statement (MNS) is required by the DHS Investment Review Process (Management Directive 1400, Appendix G) and is developed by the DHS sponsor (S&T’s customer) who represents the end users. The MNS provides a high-level description of the mission need (or, equivalently, capability gap), and is used to justify the initiation of an Acquisition program.
o Operational Requirements Document (ORD) is also required by the DHS Investment Review Process and, like the MNS, is developed by the DHS sponsor. The ORD specifies operational requirements and a concept of operations (CONOPS), written from the point of view of the end user. The ORD is independent of any particular implementation, should not refer to any specific technologies and does not commit the developers to a design.
• Solution Definition
o Performance Requirements represent a bridge between the operationally oriented view of the system defined in the ORD and an engineeringoriented view required to define the solution. Performance requirements are an interpretation, not a replacement of operational requirements. Performance requirements define the functions that the system and its subsystems must perform to achieve the operational objectives and define the performance parameters for each function. These definitions are in engineering rather than operational terms.
o Functional Specifications define the system solution functionally, though not physically. Sometimes called the “system specification” or “A-Spec,” these specifications define functions at the system, subsystem, and component level including:
• Configuration, organization, and interfaces between system
elements
• Performance characteristics and compatibility requirements • Human engineering • Security and safety • Reliability, maintainability and availability • Support requirements such as shipping, handling, storage, training
and special facilities
o Design Specifications convert the functional specifications of what the system is to do into a specification of how the required functions are to be
11

implemented in hardware and software. The design specifications therefore govern the materialization of the system components. o Material Specifications are an example of lower-level supporting specifications that support the higher-level specifications. Material specifications define the required properties of materials and parts used to fabricate the system. Other supporting specifications include Process Specifications (defining required properties of fabrication processes such as soldering and welding) and Product Specifications (defining required properties of non-developmental items to be procured commercially).
Characteristics of Good Requirements
Requirements engineering is difficult and time-consuming, but must be done well if the final product or system is to be judged by the end users as successful. From the International Council of Systems Engineers (INCOSE) Requirements Working Group1, here are eight attributes of good requirements:
Necessary: Can the system meet prioritized, real needs without it? If yes, the requirement isn't necessary.
Verifiable: Can one ensure that the requirement is met in the system? If not, the requirement should be removed or revised.
Unambiguous: Can the requirement be interpreted in more than one way? If yes, the requirement should be clarified or removed. Ambiguous or poorly worded requirements can lead to serious misunderstandings and needless rework.
Complete: Are all conditions under which the requirement applies stated? In addition, does the specification include all known requirements?
Consistent: Can the requirement be met without conflicting with any other requirement? If not, the requirement should be revised or removed.
Traceable: Is the origin (source) of the requirement known, and is there a clear path from the requirement back to its origin?
Concise: Is the requirement stated simply and clearly? Standard constructs: Requirements are stated as imperative needs using "shall."
Statements indicating "goals" or using the words "will" or “should” are not imperatives.

Developing Operational Requirements (ORDs): Customer Input
So far, we’ve discussed operational requirements but have not provided any insight into how to develop them. In an effort to provide a basic framework for the articulation and documentation of operational requirements, the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) was created. ORDs provide a clear definition and articulation of a given problem, providing several layers of information that comprise the overall problem. Using resources such as this book and the accompanying template, we have tried to simplify and streamline the process of communicating requirements. ORDs can be used in Acquisition, Procurement, Commercialization and Outreach Programs –any situation that dictates detailed requirements (e.g. RFQ, BAA, RFP, RFI, etc.). It’s clear to see that it’s cost-effective and efficient for both DHS and all of its stakeholders to communicate needs clearly and effectively.
Let’s first look at the contents of a typical Operational Requirements Document (ORD) shown in Figure 2.

The complexity of the intended system and its operational context will govern the required level of detail in the ORD. The most difficult sections to develop are probably Section 4.0, which describes the capabilities required of the system to be developed, and Section 1.6, which describes the operational and support concepts.
There is no “silver bullet” to solve the potential challenges in developing an ORD, but since the issues are universal, there is a wealth of literature that offers approaches to requirements development. As an example, here are nine requirements-elicitation techniques described in the Business Analyst Body of Knowledge (from the International Institute of Business Analysis)2.
1. Brainstorming o Purpose
• An excellent way of eliciting many creative ideas for an area of
interest. Structured brainstorming produces numerous creative ideas. o Strengths
• Able to elicit many ideas in a short time period. • Non-judgmental environment enables outside-the-box thinking.
o Weaknesses
• Dependent on participants’ creativity.
2. Document Analysis o Purpose
• Used if the objective is to gather details of the “As Is” environment
such as existing standard procedures or attributes that need to be included in a new system. o Strengths
• Not starting from a blank page. • Leveraging existing materials to discover and/or confirm requirements. • A means to crosscheck requirements from other elicitation techniques
such as interviews, job shadowing, surveys or focus groups. o Weaknesses
• Limited to “as-is” perspective. • Existing documentation may not be up-to-date or valid. • Can be a time-consuming and even tedious process to locate the
relevant information.

3. Focus Group o Purpose
• A means to elicit ideas and attitudes about a specific product, service
or opportunity in an interactive group environment. The participants share their impressions, preferences and needs, guided by a moderator. o Strengths
• Ability to elicit data from a group of people in a single session saves
time and costs as compared to conducting individual interviews with the same number of people.
• Effective for learning people’s attitudes, experiences and desires. • Active discussion and the ability to ask others questions creates an
environment where participants can consider their personal view in relation to other perspectives. o Weaknesses
• In the group setting, participants may be concerned about issues of
trust, or may be unwilling to discuss sensitive or personal topics.
• Data collected (what people say) may not be consistent with how
people actually behave.
• If the group is too homogenous, the group’s responses may not
represent the complete set of requirements.
• A skilled moderator is needed to manage the group interactions and
discussions.
• It may be difficult to schedule the group for the same date and time.
4. Interface Analysis o Purpose
• An interface is a connection between two components. Most systems
require one or more interfaces with external parties, systems or devices. Interface analysis is initiated by project managers and analysts to reach agreement with the stakeholders on what interfaces are needed. Subsequent analysis uncovers the detailed requirements for each interface. o Strengths
• The elicitation of the interfaces’ functional requirements early in the
system life cycle provides valuable details for project management: − Impact on delivery date. Knowing what interfaces are needed, their
complexity and testing needs enables more accurate project planning and potential savings in time and cost. − Collaboration with other systems or projects. If the interface to an existing system, product or device and the interface already exist, it may not be easily changed. If the interface is new, then the ownership, development and testing of the interface needs to be addressed and coordinated in both projects’ plan. In either case, eliciting the interface requirements will require negotiation and cooperation between the owning systems.
15

o Weaknesses
• Does not provide an understanding of the total system or operational
concept since this technique only exposes the inputs, outputs and key data elements related to the interfaces. 5. Interview o Purpose
• A systematic approach to elicit information from a person or group of
people in an informal or formal setting by asking relevant questions and documenting the responses. o Strengths
• Encourages participation and establishes rapport with the stakeholder. • Simple, direct technique that can be used in varying situations. • Allows the interviewer and participant to have full discussions and
explanations of the questions and answers.
• Enables observations of non-verbal behavior. • The interviewer can ask follow-up and probing questions to confirm
own understanding.
• Maintain focus using clear objectives for the interview that are agreed
upon by all participants and can be met in the time allotted. o Weaknesses
• Interviews are not an ideal means of reaching consensus across a
group of stakeholders.
• Requires considerable commitment and involvement of the
participants.
• Training is required to conduct good interviews. Unstructured
interviews, especially, require special skills. Facilitation/virtual facilitation and active listening are a few of them.
• Depth of follow-on questions may be dependent on the interviewer’s
knowledge of the operational domain.
• Transcription and analysis of interview data can be complex and
expensive.
• Resulting documentation is subject to interviewer’s interpretation.
6. Observation o Purpose
• A means to elicit requirements by assessing the operational
environment. This technique is appropriate when documenting details about current operations or if the project intends to enhance or change a current operational concept. o Strengths
• Provides a realistic and practical insight into field operations by
getting a hands-on feel for current operations.
16

• Elicits details of informal communication and ways people actually
work around the system that may not be documented anywhere. o Weaknesses
• Only possible for existing operations. • Could be time-consuming. • May be disruptive to the person being shadowed. • Unusual exceptions and critical situations that happen infrequently
may not occur during the observation.
• May not well work if current operations involve a lot of intellectual
work or other work that is not easily observable. 7. Prototyping
o Purpose
• Prototyping, when used as an elicitation technique, aims to uncover
and visualize user requirements before the system is designed or developed. o Strengths
• Supports users who are more comfortable and effective at articulating
their needs by using pictures or hands-on prototypes, as prototyping lets them “see” the future system’s interface.
• A prototype allows for early user interaction and feedback. • A throwaway prototype is an inexpensive means to quickly uncover
and confirm user interface requirements.
• A revolutionary prototype can demonstration what is feasible with
existing technology, and where there may be technical gaps.
• An evolutionary prototype provides a vehicle for designers and
developers to learn about the users’ interface needs and to evolve system requirements. o Weaknesses
• Depending on the complexity of the target system, using prototyping
to elicit requirements can take considerable time if the process is bogged down by the “how’s” rather than “what’s”.
• Assumptions about the underlying technology may need to be made in
order to present a starting prototype.
• A prototype may lead users to set unrealistic expectations of the
delivered system’s performance, reliability and usability characteristics. 8. Requirements Workshop
o Purpose
• A requirements workshop is a structured way to capture requirements.
A workshop may be used to scope, discover, define, prioritize and reach closure on requirements for the target system. Well-run workshops are considered one of the most effective ways to deliver high quality
17

requirements quickly. They promote trust, mutual understanding, and strong communications among the project stakeholders and project team, produce deliverables that structure, and guide future analysis. o Strengths
• A workshop can be a means to elicit detailed requirements in a
relatively short period of time.
• A workshop provides a means for stakeholders to collaborate, make
decisions and gain a mutual understanding of the requirements.
• Workshop costs are often lower than the cost of performing multiple
interviews.
• A requirements workshop enables the participants to work together to
reach consensus which is typically a cheaper and faster approach than doing serial interviews as interviews may yield conflicting requirements and the effort needed to resolve those conflicts across all interviewees can be very costly.
• Feedback is immediate, if the facilitator’s interpretation of
requirements is fed back immediately to the stakeholders and confirmed. o Weaknesses
• Due to stakeholders availability it may be difficult to schedule the
workshop.
• The success of the workshop is highly dependent on the expertise of
the facilitator and knowledge of the participants.
• Requirements workshops that involve too many participants can slow
down the workshop process thus negatively affecting the schedule. Conversely, collecting input from too few participants can lead to overlooking requirements that are important to users, or to specifying requirements that do not represent the needs of the majority of the users. 9. Survey/Questionnaire o Purpose
• A means of eliciting information from many people, anonymously, in
a relatively short time. A survey can collect information about customers, products, operational practices and attitudes. A survey is often referred to as a questionnaire. o Strengths
• When using ‘closed-ended’ questions, effective in obtaining
quantitative data for use in statistical analysis.
• When using open-ended questions, the survey results may yield
insights and opinions not easily obtainable through other elicitation techniques.
• Does not typically require significant time from the responders. • Effective and efficient when stakeholders are not located at one place. • May result in large number of responses.
18

• Quick and relatively inexpensive to administer.
o Weaknesses
• Use of open-ended questions requires more analysis. • To achieve unbiased-results, specialized skills in statistical sampling
methods are needed when the decision has been made to survey a sample subset.
• Some questions may be left unanswered or answered incorrectly due to
their ambiguous nature.
• May require follow up questions or more survey iterations depending
on the answers provided.
• Not well suited for collecting information on actual behaviors.
Addressing Requirements versus Proposing Solutions
When employing efforts to elicit and explain requirements using any of these methods, it is imperative to steadfastly avoid requirements that define potential solutions or otherwise restrict the potential solution space. While it is necessary and useful to understand the current state-of-the-art within a given technology space and knowledge about potential solutions that may already be in development, requirements are meant to simply define problems. Properly drafted requirements allow for a variety of solutions, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, to be considered as potential ways to address a problem. Solution-agnostic requirements prevent limiting and defining the outcome of product realization. Within the context of the Operational Requirements Document Template described in detail below, the solution definition aspect of the Requirements Hierarchy is purposefully not addressed.
This is useful given that an open and honest review of one’s needs might show that a preconceived notion about a desired solution may turn out not to be the best solution, or that modifications to existing products or services may be necessary and useful to end users.

DHS Implements a Commercialization Process to Harness Requirements
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) possesses an “Acquisition Mindset,” as do so many government agencies. While the Acquisition model has been utilized effectively in developing “custom, one-off” products such as aircraft carriers, it is not particularly germane to a majority of the needs at DHS as well as the first responders (a DHS ancillary market). The timely design, development and deployment of lower priced, widely distributed products for both DHS operating components and the first responder communities represents a critical step in protecting our nation. Recognizing this fact, the Department recently started implementing a “Commercialization Mindset” in order to leverage the vast capabilities and resources of the private sector through an innovative “win-win” private-public partnership called the SECURE (System Efficacy through Commercialization, Utilization, Relevance and Evaluation) Program.
DHS experienced several challenges merging twenty-two disparate organizations into a cohesive organization with a unified mission and culture. Those familiar with Merger and Acquisition activities realize that while integration of organizations poses difficulties, it also represents opportunities to infuse new processes and values into the newly created organization. Through both “top-down” and “bottom-up” approaches, DHS has been successful in developing, socializing and now implementing an innovative commercialization framework that has started to gain traction throughout the agency. The creation of a “Commercialization Mindset” has caught the attention of DHS managers and employees and has been embraced by senior management because of its significant benefits to the Department’s internal and external activities.
Why is there a need for a Commercialization Mindset in DHS? DHS requirements, in most instances, are characterized by the need for widely distributed COTS (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf) products. Oftentimes, the need is for thousands, if not millions, of products for DHS’ seven operating components and the fragmented, yet substantial first responder and critical infrastructure markets. The DHS commercialization process relies on providing two key pieces of information to potential solution providers in order for them to invest their valuable time, money and resources to develop products and services for use by DHS Operating Components, First Responder communities, Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources (CIKR) owner/operators and other stakeholders: 1) a clear and detailed delineation and explanation of the operational requirements, and 2) a conservative estimate of the potential available market for a potential commercialization partner to offer potential solution(s). We have forged and promulgated the development of Operational Requirements Documents (ORDs) through the publication of several books, training materials and articles to address the first half of this equation, and the following pages of a comprehensive market potential template address the latter.
25

Figure 3 This market potential template maps out many portential available markets to which DHS has direct control and responsibility or acts as a “conduit” For more information on market potential templates, please refer to Appendix I.
Conservative Estimates of Potential Available Markets
It is important to understand not only the detailed operational requirements necessary to provide DHS stakeholders with mission-critical capabilities, but also understand the volume of potential users of these solutions. DHS itself can represent a substantial potential available market; in many instances requiring hundreds, if not thousands of product or service units to address unsatisfied needs. Couple to this the fact that DHS has responsibility for so many ancillary markets (e.g. First Responders, Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources, etc.) representing large potential available markets, it is evident that substantial business opportunities exist for the private sector as these large pools of potential customers and users represent the “lifeblood” for a business (see Figure 3). We first outline top level markets. In turn, each “branch” of the template has been further segmented to hone in on detailed market opportunities.
Figure 4 shows the major differences between a “pure” Acquisition versus “pure” commercialization processes, along with the recently developed and implemented DHS “hybrid” commercialization process.
26

Pure Acquisition
– Requirements derived by Government – RFP and then cost-plus contract(s) with
developer(s) (which incentivizes long intervals)
– Focus on technical performance – Production price is secondary (often
ignored)
– Product price is cost-plus – Product reaches users via Government
deployment
Performance is King
Relationship between end users and product
developer is usually remote

Pure Commercialization

–

Requirements derived by private

sector

–

Figure 5 delineates the overall description of DHS’ new commercialization model and its first private sector outreach program called the SECURE (System Efficacy through Commercialization, Utilization, Relevance and Evaluation) Program to develop products and services in a private-public “win-win” partnership described in detail at www.dhs.gov/xres/programs/gc_1211996620526.shtm. Briefly, the SECURE Program is based on the simple premise that the private sector is willing and able to use its own money, resources, expertise and experience to develop and produce fully developed products and services for DHS if significant market potential exists. The private sector has shown remarkable interest in devoting its time and resources to such activities, if and when an attractive business case can be made related to large revenue/profit opportunities, which certainly exist at DHS and its ancillary markets. As previously stated, the private sector requires two pieces of critical information from DHS: 1. detailed operational requirement(s), and 2. a conservative estimate of the potential available market(s). This information can then be used to generate a business case for possible private sector participation in the program.
A New Model for Commercialization…
o Develop Operational Requirements Documents (ORDs) o Assess addressable market(s) o Publish ORD and market assessment on public DHS web portal,
solicit interest from potential partners in a way that is open to small, medium and large businesses
o Execute no-cost (CRADA-like) agreement with multiple private
sector entities and transfer technology and/or IP(if necessary)
o Develop supporting grants and standards as necessary o Assess T&E findings after product is developed to assure DHS and
ancillary markets that product meet its published specifications
o New Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) product marketed by
private sector with DHS support

SECURE Program
Application Selection Agreement

Publication Of Results

o Application – Seeking products/technologies aligned with posted DHS requirements o Selection – Products/Technologies TRL-5 or above, scored with internal DHS metrics o Agreement – One-page CRADA-like document that outlines milestones and exit criteria o Publication of Results – Recognized third-party T&E conducted on TRL-9
product/service. Results verified by DHS, posted on DHS web-portal to provide confidence to potential customers at DHS and its ancillary markets that product(s) meet or exceed their published specifications in reference to their actual performance.
Figure 5 Step-by-step guide to the commercialization process developed and adopted by DHS with a brief summary of the popular SECURE Program.

28

Early response from groups within DHS, the private sector, and first responders about this guide and programs like SECURE has been very favorable3-4. The Department plans to regularly update its website with Operational Requirements Documents (ORDs) to continually expand this innovative private-public partnership. In addition, as evidenced in Figure 6, the taxpayers, private sector and public sector view programs like this as “win-win-win.”

Summary
This document has offered a brief summary of the role of requirements at DHS, with particular emphasis on the requirements hierarchy including defining capability gaps and demonstrating that operational requirements govern the development of an end-user system. Acknowledging the difficulty of requirements development, it presented nine best practices to elicit requirements from an end-user community and eight criteria to judge the “goodness” of requirements. It illustrated how an Operational Requirements Document (ORD) is generated using an ORD template. We also several provided realworld examples. The additional readings listed below are a collection of short articles that provide a number of explanations on the importance of requirements development as well as some additional methods not described in this resource. We encourage you to seek out supplemental information on the topic of requirements development as this book is just one resource among many that can be of value to those developing and understanding requirements in a detailed and thoughtful way. Please take the effort to review the carefully prepared appendixes that follow as they reveal important and practical knowledge in developing operational requirements to enhance our nation’s security in a cost-effective and efficient manner. For your convenience, we have also included Appendix J, which contains the original Requirements Development Guide (April 2008) for those interested in a more detailed discussion on requirements development and product development life cycles.

Requirements Development Initiative – Operational Requirements Document (ORD) Examples
This compilation of ORDs is meant to present the reader with several real-world examples of detailed operational requirements drafted by implementing an easy-to-use ORD template that provides a basic framework in guiding the understanding and articulation of needs.
Please keep in mind the following points as you consider writing an ORD to describe and define an existing problem:
1. Writing an ORD is not as difficult as you think → so just “jump in” and give it a try 2. We’re here to help! Please use the many resources available online at http://www.dhs.gov/xres/programs/gc_1211996620526.shtm and https://dhsonline.dhs.gov/portal/jhtml/community.jhtml?index=15&community=S%26T &id=2041380003 for guidance:
- ORD templates - Example ORDs - “Developing Operational Requirements” (Version 2) 3. Some simple things to remember: - Requirements define problems while specifications define solutions - An ORD describes a problem, not a solution - Make sure your ORD is product/service/solution agnostic (that is, it does not presuppose a certain solution) - Make the solution space as wide as possible - Keep it simple and make it easy for a reader to understand your problem/requirement 4. Review the attached ORD template examples and contact us if you have any questions or comments! - SandT_Commercialization@dhs.gov

1 General Description of Operational Capability for a National Emergency Response Interoperability Framework and Resilient Communication System of Systems
1.1 Capability Gap
Interoperability and compatibility of First Responder communication systems is a mandate of the National Incident Management System (NIMS). However, as of 2008, the only interoperability systems widely in use are expensive and complicated proprietary voice-over-radio systems. These aptly described “patchwork” interoperability systems are unable to scale without additional, costly equipment coupled with costly on-site support provided by highly trained technicians. This current mode of operations is not feasible in the critical first minutes and hours of an incident response.
The vast majority of Emergency Responders are limited in their ability to communicate and collaborate with each other. They are unable to communicate with command, support teams and other responding organizations present at an incident scene. In 2008, almost 7 years after the tragic lessons learned by 9/11, the overwhelming majority of Emergency Response Organizations (ERO) does not have the basic capability for any of their team members to establish communications at an incident site. They have to wait hours for large trucks and/or trailers with very expensive1 and complicated communications equipment delivered to the site. In the case of a catastrophic incident causing a scorched earth2 environment, it may take days to get the necessary equipment and communication support personnel to the incident site.
It is not only the complexity and cost of existing systems that inhibit NIMS compliance; most systems often render previous technology investments obsolete or require a need for costly upgrades to legacy systems proving impractical or unaffordable. A system is required that creates a communications framework enabling the ability to allow not only interoperability of disparate systems, but also the ability to interconnect legacy systems and new systems.
Another major capability gap is in providing an affordable solution for the interoperability and interconnection of communication systems that support IPv4 routing with those systems that answer the Department of Defense mandate for IPv6 compliance. The cost of phasing out an IPv4 system (which is prevalent in the vast majority of state and local ERO’s, Non-Government Organizations and private sector security) is beyond realistic budgetary feasibility and would take years to accomplish.
Yet, closing this gap is mandatory. The NIMS mandate for interoperability is unattainable without a cost-effective, easy-to-implement system that provides a framework for the interoperability of data and video between responders and EROs. Data is as critical as voice communications within an incident site. If noise levels inhibit voice communications or silent communications are necessary, instant messaging is an effective tool. Video from an inexpensive webcam on a responder’s laptop may make a critical difference by providing a visual assessment to the ERO. Maps and other files needed at the incident site must get to the response team without the need to deliver files physically via courier, currently the most widely-used solution5.

Existing interoperable voice, data and video communications require fixed private networks or access to the Internet via a Virtual Private Network (VPN) requiring authentication servers and server-based network management systems. This requirement for access to remote servers creates an insurmountable capability gap for interoperable communications among responders in the hours or days they must wait for communications trucks and/or trailers to arrive at the incident scene. This ORD requires a system that provides peer-to-peer interoperability between responders and EROs without the requirement for remote servers or dedicated networks. The requirement is for secure peer-to-peer communication between any responder using any type of voice, video or data communication device and any other responder or ERO without requiring the receiving communication to be of similar device type or dedicated network. Responders at an incident site must be able to establish incident area peer-to-peer communications within minutes of responding and interoperate with EROs both at the incident site and/or remotely across readily available disparate communications networks without the need for third-party services or servers.
Even more problematic is the fact that most EROs still depend on vulnerable radio or cellular infrastructure to support expensive communication and command vehicles. Network failures caused by destruction of critical infrastructure, such as radio towers, landlines and network control centers, represent a major challenge for the public and private sectors. If they do have systems, the majority is not portable enough for easy transport to the incident scene by a first responder; or is so complicated, extensive training is required to operate the system. Very few EROs currently have portable systems whose capabilities allow a responder to establish interoperable voice, data and video communications at the incident site without technical support in ten to twenty minutes. All EROs require this capability.
Dramatically illustrated in the aftermath of the 2004-2005 hurricane season, which resulted in catastrophic damage across the Gulf States, is the ultimate example of the capability at hand. Vast areas realized devastating damage to their communications infrastructure. There was no communications resiliency. The available response recovery solutions were inadequate or failed altogether, leaving many areas where lives were at risk without communications for days.
Many critical infrastructure facilities of importance to the security of the region did not have effective communications for weeks.3 Belle Chase Naval Air Station, critical for the staging of over 30,000-rescue operations south of New Orleans, did not have reliable voice communications for nearly 96 hours after the landfall of Hurricane Katrina. With a system that meets the requirements of this ORD, the Coast Guard Rescue Operations in New Orleans would have had telephone capability and data communications within 10 to 20 minutes of beginning the emergency response. This communication could have been established by anyone at the staging area regardless of whether they had training in deploying communication networks or not.
Almost all communication systems in 2008 still require some type of fixed infrastructure in order to work and the presence of qualified technicians or engineers is required. Yet many disaster situations result in no useable infrastructure to support either local area or wide area communications.
According to an Associated Press report in 2005, “Downed telephone lines and damaged cellular towers left emergency crews confused and isolated in the aftermath of Hurricane
45

Example Only
Katrina.” The report, quoting experts, said communications systems eroded as the waters rose and only got worse.
“We had no way to communicate except by line of sight. Our radios were not operable, most landlines and cell phones were useless and our communications centers were under water. When help arrived, we could not communicate with them either." Juliette Saussy, director of Emergency Medical Service of New Orleans, told regulators.
“Some three million telephone lines were knocked out as the violent storm hit the Gulf Coast on August 29, 2005. At least 38 911-call centers went down, and more than 1,000 cellular towers were out of service. As many as 20,000 calls failed to go through the day after the storm, and about 100 TV and radio stations were knocked off the air…” FCC Chairman, Kevin Martin said.
There must be a framework for enabling communications, interoperability and collaboration that is affordable. The biggest gap in 2008 is that existing solutions are too expensive for most EROs and funding for staffing communication technicians to operate these solutions reduces the ability of most EROs to equip and staff for other vital capabilities necessary for mission effectiveness. Billions of dollars in grants are provided for solutions that will not meet the NIMS requirements. This ORD requires, not only that the technology work, but that it is affordable.
The local incidents as well as the wide area natural disasters within the past seven years clearly identify the capability gap to enable First Responders to communicate, interoperate and collaborate with each other, their command, and their support teams or with other organizations present at an incident scene within minutes of arriving at an incident site. This ORD provides the system requirements to close this vital gap in the NIMS, saving lives and increasing security.
1.2 Overall Mission Area Description
First Emergency Response Providers (FERP) by definition are the professionals who first arrive at an incident site to provide emergency medical services, security, law enforcement, assessment of the scope of the incident and recommend and coordinate an extended response if required. The mission area covered by this ORD is to outline the capabilities needed to enable FERPs to communicate and collaborate with each other, their command and interoperate with mutual aid, support teams and other responding organizations within minutes of arriving at an incident site. This ORD will also address the capabilities needed to provide interoperable voice and data systems to command in control of the incident; dynamically managing the incident as the response grows and scaling communications as required; increasing collaboration and extending the chain of command across jurisdictions. Finally, this ORD will identify the requirements of the proposed system capabilities and provide a communications framework for the creation of a dynamic, interoperable system of systems.
1.3 The Description of Resilient Portable Communications Responder Kits that Create a System of Systems.
The primary system solution that closes the capability gap and accomplishes the mission of this ORD is actually a system of systems (SoS). The SoS must meet three primary requirements. First, the SoS must be dynamic, enabling interoperability between any combinations of different communication device types; converge any type or number of disparate networks on-demand at any incident site. The SoS also fosters dynamic communications with EROs, elected officials whose
46

Example Only
districts are affected by the incident, supporting emergency operations centers (EOC), medical facilities, NGOs, military bases and private sector security involved in the area of the event. There cannot be any operational restrictions on the number of or combination of systems available to support the incident response. The requirement is the EROs and FERPs use the same softwarebased framework that is freely distributable at the incident site and can be loaded on or accessed by any device in minutes.
In order to create a dynamically interoperable SoS, the SoS must be based on software that converges network protocol types and provides network presence awareness. The SoS is required to enable data interoperability among any combinations of ad hoc, terrestrial data, telephony or satellite networks that are immediately available to the FERP or will be introduced to the SoS by other FERPs or EROs as the response develops.
The second primary requirement that must be in place to meet the mission of this ORD is human portable resilient communication systems that can provide connectivity to the interoperability framework. These systems will be in a kit form that has everything a FERP needs, to be handcarried to the incident site, transported by car, helicopter or small watercraft. The kit must be able to provide voice, video and data communication peer-to-peer among FERPs at the incident site as well as capability across any available network. If normal network infrastructure is unavailable, the kit will contain a broadband satellite system to insure connectivity beyond the incident site. The Resilient Portable Communications Kit (RPCK) will be easy to setup and in operation in 10 to 20 minutes by any FERP. The kit will require zero technical support to setup. The RPCK must seamlessly participate in an expanding system of systems. The kit will be available in multiple form factors providing EROs the flexibility to have kits carried by hand in cases, mounted in vehicles, installed in mobile EOCs or any other type of response apparatus. If an ERO needs to support largescale recovery operations, the RPCK will be modifiable to meet the requirement of the ERO.
The communication capabilities of the RPCK require:
• the ability to operate via both AC and DC power without requiring filtering. It will directly connect with any 12-volt battery, vehicle cigarette lighter adaptor, generator, tactical solar array or tactical fuel cell.
• a full featured VoIP PBX with at least 5 handsets (wired or wireless) with the ability to scale the support of VoIP handsets for every FERP at the incident site.
• wired Ethernet connectivity for a minimum of 4 external devices. • wireless access to the network for any 802.11-enabled COTS computer at the incident
site. The system’s wireless coverage will be scalable simply by deploying software definable wireless routers operating on AC or DC power deployable by the FERP. • network management software converging data, telephony and video protocols while interconnecting seamlessly and without configuration with IPv4 and/or IPv6 networks and devices. • IPv6 and IPv4 network routing with a software firewall as well as allowing external firewalls and VPNs to be used if required. • simple operating instructions with color-coded connections allowing any FERP to deploy the network without prior exposure or training to the RPCK. • the capability to add IP-based devices and peripherals as needed to support an extended response or recovery operation.
47

Example Only
• the ability to interconnect with any Land Mobile Radio Network (LMR) or cellular “push to talk” (CPT) phone patchwork interoperability system, enabling LMR or CPT devices to interoperate with any other type of device on the SoS, such as a laptop computer. This ability allows EROs utilizing IP-based devices (laptop, PDA, desktop computer) to have voice communications with LMR or CPT devices
• interoperability support with cellular systems.
The third primary requirement is the kit must be affordable and scalable. The SoS fails if the FERP does not carry resilient communications to the incident. EROs will need multiple Rocks. If the kits are too expensive they will not be available where they are needed most as an integral part of any FERP’s support equipment. The RPCK should be affordable for DHS to rapidly fund the distribution of enough kits across the United States, enabling the deployment of a resilient SoS, which in turn creates a National Communication Resiliency Network (NCRN). Even if parts, or all, of the national power and communications infrastructure are compromised or destroyed, the NCRN would survive. The following diagram details the architecture needed to create the framework of a SoS:
The kits are required to interconnect with any available IPv4 or IPv6 data network that the FERP has permission to use; providing Wide Area Network (WAN) connectivity without requiring any configuration or modifications by the FERP. By enabling the IPv6 capability, the system provides the ERO the ability to create secure collaboration with supporting agencies anywhere in the world,

on-demand. The following diagram details the capability of creating secure peer-to-peer collaboration on-demand without the need of a server.
1.4 Supporting Analysis
The following diagram is the position of components on the OSI stack necessary to support interoperability.
The contingent network in the diagram above is any available WAN connection. If a WAN connection is not available at the incident site, the RPCK will include a small broadband satellite system, with active service.

1.5 Mission the Proposed System Will Accomplish
February 28, 2003, President George W. Bush issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 (HSPD-5) which in mandating the National Incident Management System (NIMS) calls for the creation of a system that enables,
“Federal, State and Local governments to work effectively and efficiently together to prepare for, respond to and recover from domestic incidents, regardless of cause, size or complexity. To provide for interoperability and compatibility among Federal, State and Local capabilities, the NIMS will include a core set of concepts, principles, terminology, and technologies covering the incident command system, multiagency coordination systems; unified command; training; identification and management of resources (including systems for classifying types of resources); qualifications; and certification; and the collection, tracking and reporting of information and incident resources.”
The proposed SoS and RPCK would enable the accomplishment of this directive. If FERPs and EROs cannot communicate, they fail. The proposed system creates the communication resiliency necessary for an ’interoperable and compatible response’ to an incident.
Specifically the proposed system will accomplish this mission by:
• providing a communication framework that creates dynamically interoperable communications on-demand.
• providing any FERP the capability to communicate at an incident site with other responders and with anyone else who has data or telephony capability anywhere in the country with what the FERP brings to the incident site, there is no need for additional equipment.
• enabling any responder, even if it is the first time the FERP has used the kit, to set up the system in 10 to 20 minutes.
• interoperating with other systems, creating a system of systems for voice, data and video interoperability.
• providing the ability to log communications among FERPs for reporting purposes. • interconnecting command systems in a multi-agency response across disparate networks
on-demand. • creating visibility among responders to know what resources are available and
coordinate the use of those resources. • enabling the creation of ‘ad hoc” incident site, area, regional and national
communication networks as needed within minutes. • providing peer-to-peer communications that enable instant alerts, warnings and
advisories that can be viewed and responded from anywhere in the country.

Example Only 1.6 Operational and Support Concept
1.6.1 Concept of Operations The RPCK and a SoS framework can establish communications anywhere and anytime without any other support. These systems will be a part of the FERP team’s basic response tools. The system creates a system of systems with other systems and will interoperate with any other IP-based network. If FERP vehicles in every locality in the country carried the RPCK /SoS system or used the software that provides the system capabilities for legacy systems, in effect, the NCRN is created that provides communication capability even in the aftermath of a large scale infrastructure disaster. The diagram below illustrates the NCRN.
The NCRN will be available to as many FERPs and EROs as possible on a 24x7 basis. The system creates the communication resiliency and provides the capabilities to accomplish the mission only if the SoS is available to the FERP teams and their commanders. Every EOC, fire station, police station, hospital emergency room, private security force at critical infrastructure sites should have a RPCK in order to create a system of systems on-demand. In addition, key response vehicles, apparatus and command vehicles will also have systems in order to be apart of the system of systems. Finally, civilian and political leaders who are integral to the NIMS should also travel with the RPCK to guarantee their availability to collaborate by having personal communication resiliency. Sites and agencies not affected by the loss of communication capabilities, but who still need to be a part of the SoS can simply do so by running the proposed system software on their existing systems. This ability to run SoS software on any network from any location will provide the capability of a virtual on-demand NCRN, resilient by design. The SoS communication framework is agnostic of
51

Example Only
device type or network type. The SoS system framework simply requires a MAC or IP address within an IPv4 or IPv6 network.
Billions of dollars has been spent on interoperability since the NIMS mandate, but today there is no capability for interoperability of voice, video and data that can be used on a local, state, regional and national basis immediately following an incident. The proposed RPCK/SoS will provide that capability for far less than the cost of alternative systems that do not have the capability of meeting the mandate. Implementation of a program that would use the system is called for. Meeting this requirement saves hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars while also being rolled out nationally within three short years.
1.6.2 Support Concept The very nature of the SoS means providing connectivity when and where it is needed. A staff of network convergence engineers would support the system around the clock. The support engineer must have the ability to troubleshoot problems in real-time. The support engineer would have the ability to run remote diagnostics on any supported system. Because one of the major requirements of the ORD is hardware components be minimized when possible by providing network functionality with software. The majority of support issues would more than likely be related to the convergence software running the RPCK or the framework software running the SoS.
Software updates will be pushed to all systems in a planned and coordinated manner. Because the SoS is a peer-to-peer framework, updates will automatically be logged to the support database with an acknowledgement of a successful update. If updates are required at the incident site, the support engineer would have the ability to remotely update the RPCK at the incident.
If there are hardware failures with the RPCK, replacement systems and parts will be staged at regional logistic depots, which would guarantee a maximum delivery time of 8 hours to the ERO. Spare parts should be included with each RPCK for repairs that can be made by the FERP.
Live interactive webinars will be held daily on a regional basis allowing any FERP to not only receive training, but also ask for advice and share ideas with other FERPs. These webinars will be coordinated and monitored by a national support staff. Because every RPCK would provide peer-topeer video capability, enhanced support would be provided to any FERP when needed.
2 Threat
If FERPs and EROs cannot communicate, they cannot respond effectively. Lives have been lost because communications systems were not resilient or could not interoperate with other systems at the incident. Rescue operations cannot be coordinated; assets requested or deployed all while valuable time is lost without critical communications capability.
On a local level incident response, too many missions are compromised because under-funded EROs cannot afford easy-to-use resilient communication systems. The systems sold to them are too expensive and require costly support. Complex systems requiring this type of support take resources away from other critical roles.
In most cases, as communications systems funding becomes available, EROs do not possess the knowledge or experience to adequately obtain a system that addresses all the communication risks
52

Example Only
they will face in a disaster. There are no standards published that give them guidance on possible solutions that will meet the demands necessary to implement this ORD. Instead, they rely on existing relationships with vendors or salespeople, who themselves are not skilled or adept in disaster recovery communications. These resources work for very large companies whose business model relies on proprietary technology that does not allow other manufacturers’ products to integrate. Often times EROs find that what they get is not what they thought they were buying. There are dozens of anecdotal stories of EROs spending millions to deploy systems that do not accomplish the intended mission and when they complain they are informed they will need to spend millions more to actually get the system to do what they need, if indeed the system can do what they need.
On a state and regional level where interoperability exists, only certain types of radio systems have this ability. These systems depend on an infrastructure with no resiliency. Major budget dollars spent on incident management software and services by EROs to manage incidents on a regional or state basis will not work if they do not have connectivity to the Internet. Alert and warning systems have become a major business since the Virginia Tech tragedy, but they all depend on networks that provide no resiliency. If power fails, campus communications fail. You cannot send a SMS alert and have any guarantee the message was received if you are depending on a highly vulnerable cellular network. If you send an emergency email, there is no way to guarantee that the multiple email servers required for the delivery of the email will be available and able to deliver the increased amounts of email generated due to an event. Not only are EROs creating plans that will fail without resilient and an interoperable communication framework, they are spending hundreds of millions of dollars building a false sense of readiness.
There currently is no interoperable resilient national communication solution across federal, state and local EROs. Solutions that will take decades, costing billions of dollars and do not provide resilient interoperability are a major threat to homeland security. Big budget telecommunications projects follow the failed philosophy of “you throw enough money at a problem it will be fixed”, thus leading EROs to ignore the existing vulnerabilities that could be addressed by less costly and more practical solutions. Too many telecommunications professionals are still pushing 20th century technologies to address 21st century problems. A response to a pandemic, major terrorist strike at key infrastructure, cyber attack on telecommunication centers, super regional earthquakes and catastrophic oil shortages planned to cripple the US economy or any other scenario with national impact will fail because current communications infrastructure will be compromised or worse yet, destroyed. Without communications, EROs are blind, deaf and mute to any coordinated national response. There is no capability to create a national “ad hoc” communications network for a coordinated national response. This inability leaves NIMS vulnerable to failing on a catastrophic level.
Finally, the greatest threat is ignoring the plurality of our system of government. Incident response always starts at the local level; expenditures must happen at the local level. It is impractical to implement a federally mandated one-size-fits-all system. William Waugh of Georgia State University in Atlanta points out in his paper “Terrorism, Homeland Security and the National Emergency Management Network”
“On September 11, 2001, officials and agencies that are part of the national emergency management system orchestrated the responses to the collapse of the World Trade Center towers and the fires at the Pentagon. The efforts of local, state, and federal emergency
53

Example Only
agencies were augmented by nonprofit organizations, private firms, and organized and unorganized volunteers. The system reacted much as it would have for a major earthquake or similar disaster. In the rush to create federal and state offices to deal with the threat of terrorism and, ultimately, to create a Department of Homeland Security, the very foundation of the nation's capacity to deal with large-scale disasters has been largely ignored. Although the human and material resources that the emergency management network provides may again be critical in a terrorist-spawned catastrophe, the new Homeland Security system may not be capable of utilizing those resources effectively. The values of transparency, cooperation, and collaboration that have come to characterize emergency management over the past decade seem to be supplanted in the new command-and-control-oriented Homeland Security system. If that occurs, when the resources of the national emergency management system are needed most, the capacity to utilize the system may be severely damaged and cultural interoperability will be a serious problem.”
Avoiding this problem lies in a communication system that is based on the concepts of the SoS called for by this ORD. All of the efforts of the National Emergency Management Network (NEMN) is wasted without a NCRN. Ham radios alone will not coordinate the management of a national response effort. EROs and FERPs need resilient voice and data communication capability that will interoperate with other EROs and FERPs.
3 Existing System Shortfalls
Why do current systems fall short of providing the capability to meet the NIMS requirements?
“To provide for interoperability and compatibility among Federal State and Local capabilities, the NIMS will include a core set of concepts, principles, terminology, and technologies covering the incident command system, multi-agency coordination systems; unified command; training; identification and management of resources (including systems for classifying types of resources); qualifications; and certification; and the collection, tracking and reporting of information and incident resources.”
Specifically, current systems fall short in these areas:
• Most systems are not resilient. Systems that depend on a fixed infrastructure, dedicated networks and proprietary technology are not reliable in a response to a major disaster or infrastructure failure. Most systems take days if not weeks to restore when they fail. Without communications, NIMS plans fail.
• The requirements published for NIMS compliance by EROs lack a communications framework that simplifies the process of implementing a system that meets the requirement for interoperability and compatibility. Most EROs lack the technical resources to filter through the plethora of available systems. In many cases, communications specialists who are making these decisions are only experienced in analog radio systems or telephony and are being forced to make IP networking decisions in which their lack of knowledge leads them to spend their budget on systems that only provide part of the capability they need. EROs need options that work within a
54

Example Only
communications framework that will guarantee interoperability and compatibility with any agency or ERO.
• Systems are too expensive. The ERO buys a system that is limited by budget or grant realities. This result is limited capability. They have what they can afford, not what they need. Every ERO and FERP need full resilient communications capability.
• Systems are too complicated. One major provider of systems that any ERO would deem reliable is selling a solution that requires three (3) certified technicians to operate. The ERO has a powerful system that will cost more in five years to operate than it cost to purchase. A FERP will not have the needed communication capability if the technician cannot get to the incident scene. This could take hours in most cases and in the case of a major disaster, days.
• Many systems rely on proprietary technology that can only integrate with like devices. The major providers of communication systems provide systems based on proprietary technology that drives up the price for the ERO to not only acquire and support, but also make it difficult and expensive to interoperate with other EROs. In some scenarios, voice, video and data interoperability between different proprietary systems is not feasible.
• Many systems will fail to provide resilient communication because they are so cumbersome they require dedicated power and transportation, rendering them useless to the FERP in the first critical minutes of a response. Semi-trailers cannot travel over roads blocked by fallen trees and downed power lines. Due to the flooding, responding to Katrina meant having to fly systems and technicians in by helicopter or small planes, taking days to provide communication capabilities for rescue operations. If the systems are simple to use and FERP-portable, they could and should go to the incident site with the FERP.
• Since there is no current framework to create a system of systems today, even the grant process for funding systems is slowed down. Without a framework, it is a daunting challenge for a multi-agency grant process to verify what is being bought by the ERO is necessary and will meet the mission requirements. With a SoS, it becomes feasible to require systems be compliant with the framework, making purchasing decisions and grant processes easier.
• Most ERO systems networks are IPv4 and not IPv6 compliant. The majority of FERPs would not even notice the difference, but a system that is not IPv6 compliant is more difficult to secure in trying to support interoperability. These security concerns by themselves can cause any mutual response to fall short of the requirement for interoperability and compatibility.
• Current systems also fall short because, due to a lack of an interoperability framework supporting systems being apart of a system of systems, it is problematic if not impossible to allow EROs not only to interoperate with other EROs and FEMA, but NGOs, military and private sector security as well. Without a communications framework supporting
55

Example Only
communications across organizations, a mutual-aid response will likely fall short on what is needed for an effective response and rapid recovery.

o First Responder Identification Credential (FRAC) support o Public Law 110-53 compliance .
4.2 Key Performance Parameters (KPPs)
The key performance parameters for the SoS and the RPCK are:
• Resiliency - interoperable communications must be able to establish voice and data communications within 15 minutes from the time of arrival at the incident site. The system must provide required communications capability even if all communications infrastructure is compromised or destroyed. Redundant communication must be provided with the RPCK. If the VoIP services are not working, the FERP should be able to have peer-to-peer voice capability with anyone on the SoS. If conditions are not favorable for audio communications, the FERP should be able to send private and public instant messages or alerts and advisories using the SoS software.
• Accessibility - Communications must be established by a FERP without the need for technical support. No configuration of the software should be required to setup the RPCK. The system will be connected to the best available network and connected to an AC or DC power with phone and Internet services available to all FERPs.
• Portability – The FERP must have a portable solution they can carry with them to the incident to assure they will have communications capability immediately upon arrival. RPCKs must be man portable and operate independent of large vehicles and/or trailers.
• Interoperability - The SoS provides full interoperable voice, video and data communications among FERPS and supporting agencies and EROs regardless of communication device types. The interoperability must be dynamic. Dynamic interoperability is the ability to connect any user across any network and have the ability to connect any IP communication device with any other IP communication device. The interoperability must be at level 4 or 5 of the communication layer enabling the SoS to connect any network and run on any IP device. The SoS should also enable interoperability between interoperable radio and telephone switching systems and any data user of the SoS.
• Expandability - The SoS must not have any limitation on the number of users it can support. The number of interconnected networks cannot be limited. The RPCK must be scalable either by linking multiple RPCKs together or by running the SoS on a larger Resilient Communication Command System (RCCS). A RCCS should be able to support hundreds of users exactly as a RPCK supports dozens of users. The RCCS must also be tactical and transportable, but the need for greater scalability will limit the method of transportation to an SUV or pick-up truck. Except the RCCS should not only offer the same features and functionality as a RPCK, but also be as easy to setup and come in a kit form. Because of the greater processing power of a RCCS, the area of coverage will increase, providing greater flexibility.
58

Example Only
• Visibility - The SoS must be able to allow span of control and mutual assessment and collaboration at and beyond the incident area site. The software interface must support a span of control over the users allowing for grouping users into manageable groups and subgroups without compromising security. The ability to group should be as simple as entering a code that will direct the user to their group, while allowing incident command the ability to see all resources. Peer-to-peer voice, video and data communication must allow users on demand the ability to have private one-on-one communication or private group conversations, while at the same time having incident wide communications.
• Transparency - The SoS must not only enable the interoperability of voice, video and data communications, but it must also interconnect and support other systems and networks providing alert, warnings and advisories. The SoS software will enable alerts and advisories between any FERP or ERO without needing anything but the SoS software. The alerts and advisory capability will expand to provide public advisories.
• Flexibility - The RPCK must provide a full featured software PBX that is configurable from an easy-to-use GUI interface providing QoS and options to meet the ERO and FERP requirements. The PBX should provide a toll-free DID and support hundreds of extensions if needed. The PBX will have defined calling features available for configuration by the ERO. The RPCK must support as many simultaneous calls as the backhaul will allow. The SoS should also support both IPv4 and IPv6 networking and the RPCK should provide IPv6 capability to EROs who only have IPv4 capability.
• Usability - The RPCK and SoS must work with both AC and DC power, be network agnostic and able to work in any type of weather or climate that the FERP is operating in. The RPCK should require no special environmental conditions. The RPCK must converge the network protocols involved in providing voice, video and data so that network configurations are automatically provided to the user. The FERP should be able to connect color-coded cable, power the system up and have full communication capability.
• Adaptability - The SoS communication framework must be built using XML to allow for the rapid implementation of services and development or integration of applications used for collaboration. The FERP must be able to create a system of systems, enabling scalability, interconnectivity and rapid data convergence among all responders in minutes, for all responding mutual aid agencies, remote support and chain of command. This capability will not require dedicated technical resources to maintain. The SoS and RPCK must function in any environment without need of other systems if they are not available, but seamlessly interconnect to those systems without requiring the FERP to do anything. The RPCK will turn any vehicle into a forward command post for areas that have been cutoff or are a HAZMET site. The system will go anywhere in the country and work without modifications or additional configurations.
• Affordability - The SoS is affordable to the ERO. The software enabling peer-to-peer interoperability will be freely distributed with the ERO only paying for the delivery medium. The cost of the communications framework software should decrease with the number of groups within the ERO’s span of control and should be available as a software service if the ERO has limited technical resources for organizational installation and system
59

administration. The RPCK must be COTS compliant and provide volume-pricing incentives.
4.3 System Performance.
There are many types of disasters in the United States, but the most common emergencies are: Chemical Emergencies Dam Failure Earthquake Fire or Wildfire Flood Hazardous Material Heat Hurricane Landslide Nuclear Power Plant Emergency Pandemics Terrorism Thunderstorm Tornado Tsunami Volcano Wildfire Winter Storm
60

Example Only
4.3.1 Mission Scenarios Preparation and/or planning for these scenarios are paramount to enable recovery. The first and foremost consideration must be the lives of any potential victims or personnel within the immediate area of the incident site. Secondly, no situation, no matter how small, should ever be viewed in any other term than worse case scenario. If emergency responders are prepared for the worst possible situation, they inevitably will increase their odds for success. Those who fail to plan and fail to prepare are our greatest liabilities. The most frightening and destructive phenomena’s of nature (e.g. Hurricane, Tornado, Earthquake, Tsunami, Wild Fires, or Flooding) strike suddenly, violently, and many times in the event of an earthquake or tornado they occur without warning. If an earthquake or tornado occurs in a populated area, it may cause many deaths, injuries, and extensive property damage. There are no guarantees for safety following a disaster, identifying potential hazards ahead of time and advance planning can save lives and significantly reduce injuries and property damage. In the event of a disaster, EROs are required to do an assessment of the damage prior to allowing safety personnel and restoration groups into the incident area. Most likely, this would require communications in a scorched earth environment. FERPs would be required to setup and deploy the SoS in the disaster region and communicate to other reporting agencies to coordinate relief and aid.
In the event of a Man-Made Disaster (e.g. Terrorist or Enemy-Nation Attack) the ERO would require a number of FERP teams respond and report. The needs now are to have interoperability with these team members to include establishing two-way radio communications, data transmissions to and from multiple agencies as well as establishing an Incident Area Command Center (IACC) with full voice telephony communications mandated. If the immediate responsibility of the ERO is to assess the damages by physically entering the disaster area providing an
61

Example Only
assessment to the IACC in order to organize and manage the critical next steps of the rescue, video transmission may be required to ascertain the damages and environmental impact.
In all cases of the aforementioned disasters, all EROs need to asses the damage within the incident area, establishing communication to and from the incident site, enabling them to relay information of assessments to decision making authorities that enables them to conclude on the critical decisions for recovery. This would require the ERO to have minimal setup steps in deploying communications since the focus must be the disaster site. The SoS must be able to quickly deploy in different scenarios and adapt to different topologies of networks and environments seamlessly.
62

Example Only
Within 10 to 20 minutes of the FERPs’ arrival at the incident area, IACC should be able to move into rescue operations. The system must now move to providing LAN and WAN capability, allowing responding personnel and agencies the ability to interoperate immediately.
63

Example Only
Not all responses are for emergency operations, some exceptions are large-scale events (e.g. Republican or Democratic National Convention, Super Bowl, National Sports Events, Concerts, Demonstrations or Political Rallies). These types of events can often cripple existing communication layers with an influx of traffic generated at the event site. The ERO must have the ability to over come these obstacles easily and seamlessly. The FERP must have the ability to support two-way communications as well as telephony communications. In addition, the FERP must have the ability to send video data to and from the event site. Typically, in these types of situations, FERP members often work with civilian security and/or corporate personnel where interoperability is just a word in the dictionary. Many agencies are responsible for security at large scale events where tens of thousands of people attend. In many cases, multiple agencies, public and private are "working" the event in some manner. All require a system that establishes a LAN and WAN for all to utilize quickly and easily. In addition, this system must be able to utilize any current network infrastructure or establish its own infrastructure immediately.

 Public Law 110-53 compliance.  4.3.3 Interoperability Interoperability provided by software that creates a communication framework enables any IP device or system to create a system of systems allowing interconnectivity between any IPv4 or IPv6 user device and multiple IPv4 or IPv6 networks. Any FERP can communicate using voice, video or share data with any other FERP; limited only by the capability of their device (i.e. a LMR would be limited to voice communications). The FERP can communicate with their ERO and can collaborate with other agencies and FROs, NGO, military response teams or private sector security that may be responding to the incident. If responding organizations do not have the software prior to the incident, the SoS software that is included with every RPCK can be freely distributed from any FERP to anyone who needs it. This allows interoperability to be dynamic, changing to meet the communication needs as the response grows and evolves.
69

Example Only
The only requirement for interoperability is that the FERPs terminal or device has an IP or MAC address. If the use of analog devices are part of the EROs response plan the analog network can be given an IP or MAC address by connecting one of the analog terminals using the analog network be connected to a patchwork interoperability switch that in turn is a part of the SoS.
4.3.4 Human Interface Requirements Based on a communications framework required by this ORD, the strength of a system of systems is based software that will run on any operating system, which will run on an IPv4 or IPv6 networks. There are no special human interface requirements other than knowing how to use a common phone, a LMR or computer. If the FERP can access and use day-to-day computer applications used by the ERO, then they will be able to run the SoS software. It is easier than sending an email. The FERP can use devices and terminals they already use.
The RPCK standard form factor will weigh less than 40lbs, allowing any FERP to hand carry the kit if necessary. The SoS and RPCK should require no specialized personnel at the incident site. Any FERP should be able to set up a RPCK in 10 to 20 minutes even if they have no experience or training. No matter how well designed the system is, systems do require support due to user, hardware or software malfunction. If for any reason support should be required due to equipment failure, the user must be able to use the troubleshooting guide included with the system. Aroundthe-clock telephone and online support will be available from the RPCK provider. The human interface requirement for this system requires the FERP to be able to read simple instructions.
4.3.5 Logistics and Readiness The SoS will be up and utilized constantly by EROs. It can provide inter-agency interoperability on a daily basis and be in operation when an incident occurs. As the FERP arrives at the incident site, interoperability and collaboration are immediate just by the FERP turning on the devices they are using; the FERP connects automatically to the SoS.
In order to facilitate interoperability with EROs and FERPs that do not have the SoS software, the software must be available to every FERP on a USB thumb-drive that can be used to freely install on any computer required to join the SoS. The installation software should also be available to load on ERO servers so that the software can be freely downloaded if necessary. The SoS software should also be downloadable from approved websites with proper security clearance. Installation of the software must be quick, simple and intuitive. No training should be necessary for any FERP to install the software and connect to the SoS.
If the device is only able to run on an IPv4 network, free VPN software must be available for installation. Installing and using the VPN should require no configuration. If a VPN is needed it should be as simple as clicking on ‘install VPN” and the VPN must automatically install, configure and connect the FERP to the SoS via the VPN.
If software updates are released for the SoS or RPCK, a release method of freely upgrading will be implemented.
70

Example Only
At least one RPCK should be available to every ERO in the country. Because a requirement for the RPCK is that it be a self-contained kit, distribution of new kits, additional kits, accessories such as additional VoIP handsets, cameras, headsets, cables, satellite systems should be managed under a contract with a national technology logistics company. Logistics must be handled by an organization, which specializes in delivering network technology efficiently to the public/private sector. Efficient distribution and parts should be stored in strategically located sites in order to guarantee delivery to the ERO in less than 8 hours. A just-in-time inventory method should be used to avoid using public funds to stockpile systems. A purchasing system should be instituted to guarantee EROs the ability, once a state of emergency is declared, to order additional systems, parts and accessories immediately.
4.3.6 Other System Characteristics The SoS and RPCK will be simple to use and affordable. VoIP services will be provided with a flat rate annual contract for unlimited calls. Every RPCK will have an available satellite option for resiliency; the cost of constant satellite services will be affordable. DHS should negotiate flat rate contracts with providers for on-demand satellite service when the RPCK is deployed. Every system should always be on and able to support a phone call to the national support center requesting that additional bandwidth be provided for the duration of the incident. Without a national plan, the cost of satellite services may be more than the cost and maintenance of the kit.
5 System Support
5.1 Maintenance
A maintenance agreement should be in place on every SoS system and RPCK.
The SoS will run around the clock, if issues arise, users should contact the support desk. The support will be available unceasingly for SoS. If updates to the SoS software are needed, the update will be sent directly to the user by the support desk and will be downloadable from a support website.
The RPCK must be used regularly in everyday operations or be required to be tested twice a month to be confident that there are no problems with the kit’s performance. The day-and-night support center must have the ability to run remote diagnostics on any kit and if possible repair the system remotely. If a kit has a component failure that cannot be immediately fixed at the users’ location with the assistance of the support desk, a loaner will be shipped to the ERO immediately. The ERO will ship the “down” system to the repair depot. Under the support maintenance agreement the loaner system is provided at no charge until their repair kit is returned and tested by the ERO. A ratio of loaners available to kits in service will be 1 to 30.
5.2 Supply
The installation software will also be available on ERO servers so that the software can be downloaded from the ERO server if necessary. The SoS software should also be downloadable from approved, secure websites with proper authorization. Installation of the software must be quick, simple and intuitive. No training should be necessary for any FERP to install the software and connect to the SoS.
71

Example Only
Because a requirement of the RPCK is self-containment, distribution of new kits, additional kits, loaner kits should be available if a RPCK fails. Accessories such as additional VoIP handsets, cameras, headsets, cables, satellite systems should be managed under a contract with a national technology logistics company that specializes in delivering network technology efficiently to the private/public sector. Efficient distribution requires parts be stored in strategically located depots in order guarantee delivery to the ERO in less than 8 hours. A just-in-time inventory method is required to avoid using public funds to stockpile systems. A purchasing system is required to guarantee EROs the ability, once a state of emergency is declared, to order additional systems, parts and accessories immediately.
5.3 Support Equipment
The RPCK will include any equipment necessary for testing and the system must be available to be tested remotely by support if need. The remote diagnostics will require nothing more than the customer’s approval.
5.4 Training
The SoS and RPCK will be simple enough that user training is not required. However, in order to maximize the power of the SoS and to fully understand what the RPCK is capable of, webinars will be held everyday on a regional basis covering topics that will improve the effective use of the SoS and RPCK. An online group forum will be available for FERPs to share ideas and ask questions of other FERPs. This service will be a feature of the SoS software.
5.5 Transportation and Facilities
The SoS is software and does not require transportation or storage. The RPCK by design must be small enough to store in the trunk of a car or in a closet in the FERPs office or duty station. It will be able to be stored anywhere with a temperature between minus ten degrees Celsius and fifty degrees Celsius. The RPCK will require no special transportation; however, it must be available in a form factor that can be mounted in any vehicle, making that vehicle a mobile resilient communication center. It also will be able to be used anywhere at anytime without any special installation being required and easily be transportable as carry-on luggage on any commercial airline.
6 Force Structure
Many homeland security applications rely on resilient communications; there can be no SoS without communications systems to connect to. In order to implement a national SoS providing national interoperability, enough RPCKs must be distributed across the country to provide resilient communication in enough locations to guarantee a national emergency communication network can be created from a system of systems. It would take 200,000 RPCKs to provide at least one system to each of the following:
72

Example Only
Potential system users
Law enforcement agencies in the United States Fire departments in the United States Incorporated cities in the United States Counties and or Parish Governments in the United States School Districts and Colleges in the United States Emergency Operation Centers in the United States Ports of entry in the United States Critical Infrastructure and Key Assets in the United States Hospitals in the United States

Approximate Number 17,000 30,000 80,000 3,000 20,000 15,000 240 33,000 5,500

These numbers do not reflect the number of court houses whether Federal, State, District or Local, the number of jails and or prisons, total number of Federal Government agencies buildings or personnel in the United States, the number High Schools, Middle Schools or Elementary Schools in the United States. The numbers also do not reflect the number of substations and offices within a particular category. If a RPCK was distributed to each of the 53,000 fire stations alone, the infrastructure for a national resilient communications network would be in place.
The SoS will be distributed to every FERP (as many as one million copies in the first six months) in the country as soon as possible, even without a kit the SoS can be created and as long as communication infrastructure is sound, a local, regional, state and national interoperability network will be created enabling collaboration and cooperation.
7 Schedule
The SoS should be rolled out in phases. Year one should establish SoS groups in the most vital areas creating a national framework of senior FERPs, EROs and supporting agencies with a nationwide roll-out completed in less than four years.
8 System Affordability
The total price for core components to meet the mission described in the ORD shall be less than $20,000 (in high volume production).

Resilient System of Systems
Dynamic Interoperability IPv4

Recovering readily from injury, adversity, or the like while returning to the original form.
A collection of task-oriented or dedicated systems that pool their resources and capabilities together to obtain a new, more complex, 'meta-system' which offers more functionality and performance than simply the sum of the constituent systems.
A property referring to the ability of diverse systems and organizations to work together (inter-operate) characterized by continuous change, activity, or progress.
Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is the fourth iteration of the Internet Protocol (IP) and it is the first version of the protocol to be widely deployed. IPv4 is the dominant network layer protocol on the Internet and apart from IPv6 it is the only standard internetwork-layer protocol used on the Internet.
IPv4 is a data-oriented protocol to be used on a packet switched internetwork (e.g., Ethernet). It is a best effort protocol in that it does not guarantee delivery. It does not make any guarantees on the

correctness of the data; this may result in duplicated packets or packets delivered out of order. These aspects are addressed by an upper layer protocol (e.g. TCP, and partly by UDP).
Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a network layer for packetswitched internetworks. It is designated as the successor of IPv4, the current version of the Internet Protocol, for general use on the Internet.
The main change brought by IPv6 is a much larger address space that allows greater flexibility in assigning addresses.
The large number of addresses allows a hierarchical allocation of addresses that make routing and renumbering simpler. With IPv4, complex CIDR techniques were developed to make the best possible use of a restricted address space. Renumbering, when changing providers, can be a major effort with IPv4. With IPv6, however, renumbering becomes largely automatic, because the host identifiers are decoupled from the network provider identifier.

1 General Description of Operational Capability
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) requires the capability to commercially lease reusable, medium altitude Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance family of systems to augment Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), United States Coast Guard (USCG), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in support of their mission areas. The leasing of this family of systems should be low cost compared to DHS acquisition, operations and maintenance of MQ-9 Predator B unmanned aircraft, have high reliability, maintainability and availability, be easily transportable, and provide full connectivity at all levels of command and control. This family of systems lease includes tactical unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), medium altitude long endurance (MALE) UAS, and the command and control connectivity to provide all appropriate DHS nodes full motion video, voice, and data transmission and reception at all echelons. Each UAS is packaged as a “fly away kit” which can be transported to any required border region in support of CBP, and moved as necessary in support of USCG, ICE, and FEMA. The required C2 connectivity is also self-contained and can be transported to the appropriate location as required to support the missions. These “kits” are designed to be scalable, and tailorable to support DHS needs.
1.1 Capability Gap
CBP is actively engaged in the Secure Border Initiative to attain the ability to gain operational control of our nation’s borders by providing 24-hour, year-round surveillance capabilities that will help deter illegal entry attempts into the United States, and enable USBP agents to detect, analyze, and rapidly respond to illegal cross border activity. The MQ-9 Predator B Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) augments Customs and Border Protection Air and Marine (CBP A&M) assets supporting ground interdiction agents on the Southwest Border. CBP A&M is engaged in the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) mission to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce its vulnerability to terrorism, minimize damage from attacks that might occur, and streamline recovery efforts. CBP A&M accomplishes this mission through an integrated and coordinated air and marine force engaged in the detection, interdiction, and prevention of acts of terrorism arising from unlawful movement of people or illegal drugs and other contraband. However, this capability is resource constrained and is assumed to be so for the foreseeable future. Currently, CBP A&M operates 4 MQ-9 UAS in support of southwest, southeast, and northern border regions, in addition to over 260 manned aircraft throughout these three border regions. A persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) family of systems can readily augment CBP A&M and provide both enhanced capability and improved persistence at a lower cost per flight hour. The family of systems immediately provides a turnkey, “power by the hour” ability to apply additional UAS into an area of interest, increasing sensor dwell time, reducing revisit rates, and accomplishes this at a much lower cost compared to using manned aircraft.
The capabilities described in this ORD also support the DHS objective of Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) which is the effective understanding of anything associated with the global maritime domain that could impact the security, safety, economy, or
81

Example Only
environment of the United States. MDA is the integration of Global Maritime Intelligence and Global Maritime Situational Awareness. Global Maritime Intelligence is the product of legacy, as well as changing intelligence capabilities, policies and operational relationships used to integrate all available data, information, and intelligence in order to identify, locate, and track potential maritime threats. A persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) family of systems enhances MDA by providing increased numbers of sensors, superior persistence, at a lower cost than manned alternatives.
The United States Coast Guard is a military, multi-mission, maritime service within the Department of Homeland Security and one of the nation's five armed services. Its core roles are to protect the public, the environment, and U.S. economic and security interests in any maritime region in which those interests may be at risk, including international waters and America's coasts, ports, and inland waterways. USCG protects America's maritime borders from all intrusions by: (a) halting the flow of illegal drugs, aliens, and contraband into the United States through maritime routes; (b) preventing illegal fishing; and (c) suppressing violations of federal law in the maritime arena.
USCG Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can provide persistent wide area surveillance at both strategic and tactical levels. Access to sensor coverage and data provided by UAVs may reduce some operational requirements for conventional aircraft, by extending the mission reach of Coast Guard operational units. UAVs will contribute to a range of missions, including maritime border protection; law and treaty enforcement; and search & rescue. To date, the USCG has not acquired any UAV systems, but instead is collaborating with CBP to provide an interim unmanned capability using a portion of their MQ-9 assets, stretching thinner a four vehicle fleet. A persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) family of systems can fill this critical gap, by providing dedicated systems to support USCG that can ensure dedicated capacity to support USCG missions.
The primary mission of the Federal Emergency Management Agency is to reduce the loss of life and property and protect the Nation from all hazards, including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters, by leading and supporting the Nation in a risk-based, comprehensive emergency management system of preparedness, protection, response, recovery, and mitigation. A persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) family of systems could provide dedicated UAS assets to assist FEMA in damage assessment, search and rescue, and Chemical-BiologicalNuclear-Radiological and Explosive (CBRNE) consequence management.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the largest investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is responsible for eliminating vulnerabilities in the nation's border, and with economic, transportation and infrastructure security. ICE intelligence professionals process information from a variety of sources to provide assessments of patterns, trends and new developments in a wide range of law enforcement areas. Intelligence focuses on data and information related to the movement of people, money and materials into, within and out of the United States, to provide
82

Example Only
accurate and timely reporting to ICE leadership and field agents in support of enforcement operations. A persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) family of systems could provide dedicated UAS assets to assist ICE in support of their mission.
1.2 Overall Mission Area Description
This ORD supports the following Office of the Secretary of Homeland Security Mission Areas: Land Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Maritime Surveillance and Reconnaissance, information sharing, and command and control.
1.3 Description of the Proposed Product or System
The persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) family of systems will build on the capabilities existing in the CBP, USCG, FEMA and ICE and provide significant, additive capability to DHS. It provides a loitering and persistent capability not previously available to personnel at all echelons, from the border patrol agent monitoring the southern US border, first responders, Coast Guardsmen, all the way up to the President of the United States. Each persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) family of systems will have a baseline payload of sensors that offer multi-spectral acquisition capability. The system will be flexible enough to add additional combinations of payloads and the capability to carry interchangeable, but compatible, payloads for flexibility. The ISR family of systems aircraft and mission payloads will be remotely operated throughout the range of DHS operations. The system will collect and process information that can then be reported or further exploited to accomplish the intelligence functions of indications and warning, support to appropriate DHS agencies and departments requiring surveillance and reconnaissance services. The ISR family of systems includes a variety of commercial off the shelf (COTS) remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) systems, associated payload(s), data link(s), ground station(s), communications and dissemination systems, logistics support packages, and an ability to accomplish the following functions: Command and Control (C2) of multiple air vehicles and payloads; compliance with all appropriate communications architectures that permit interoperability with any other system that complies with standard formats for data and direct dissemination via the data link. Additional exploitation system capability can also be added, at the discretion of DHS.

This ORD supports DHS S&T continuing need to develop the means for greater first responder participation in the definition of capability gaps in order to ensure their high priority needs are met. DHS customers’ critical needs take the form of Enabling Homeland Capabilities (EHCs), consisting of technologies that can be developed, matured, delivered, and commercialized or validated as a standard within a 3-year period. This ORD directly addresses the following EHCs:
Border Security DHS S&T Leads: Customs & Border Protection and Immigration & Custom Enforcement
• Detection, tracking, and classifying of all threats along the terrestrial and maritime border including numerous topographies such as rugged terrain, concealing foliage, water obstacles, mountains, and other environmental constraints
Infrastructure Protection DHS S&T Lead: Office of Infrastructure Protection

Interoperability DHS S&T Leads: Federal Emergency Management Agency and Office of Emergency Communications
• Standardize, pilot, and evaluate emergent wireless broadband data technologies and applications
• Provide seamless access to voice and data networks, using a unified communications device
1.5 Mission the Proposed System Will Accomplish
The missions that the persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) family of systems will accomplish include, but are not limited to:
• Border Security • Port Security • Natural Disaster Response
84

Example Only
• Search and Rescue • Man-Made Disaster Response • Special Security Event Support
1.6 Operational and Support Concept
1.6.1 Concept of Operations The persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) family of systems will function as a stable of dynamically re-taskable assets, able to combine all elements of the ISR process. It will leverage existing COTS capabilities to increase mission effectiveness and create synergies for DHS. The family of systems will rapidly flex between Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, search and rescue, and disaster response where appropriate. The family of systems will operate primarily at medium altitudes, but will also contain capability for short range, low altitude operations in supporting DHS. It will seamlessly integrate with existing DHS assets from CBP, USCG, FEMA, and ICE as well as other government agencies as DHS shall direct. The family of systems will extend the department’s eyes in the area of operations and provide the ability to immediately transition to a different role when appropriate. Command and control (C2) through all echelons will enable the family of systems to rapidly transition within the ISR collector, communications relay, and search and rescue roles. The family of systems will integrate with existing DHS agency C2 concepts and organizations and existing tactics, techniques, and procedures: operational control will be exercised through the appropriate DHS agency, and the platforms will deconflict using normal air traffic control and airspace control measures, such as a temporary flight restriction (TFR). Its persistence and ability to communicate with C2 nodes and other DHS assets render the ability to accomplish critical DHS missions under adverse surface weather conditions. The family of systems will use off-board data, robust sensors, and automatic cueing to detect persons in areas of interest. Immediate, automated processing of data will derive actionable coordinates to assist other DHS assets to accomplish their respective missions. Improved communications/data links and situational awareness displays will ensure full area of interest integration at all DHS command and control echelons. A modular architecture permits tailored mission flexibility, where the family of systems acts as the platform to employ specialized sensor payloads, such as communication relay. The family of systems will offer DHS personnel and planners a low-cost, persistent capability to perform a wide variety of DHS missions augmenting existing assets in achieving desired outcomes. It will seamlessly integrate with manned and unmanned platforms on the ground, in the air, and in space. Digital, open-ended, machine-level interfaces will leverage information technology to rapidly and accurately locate, identify, and act on critical emerging items of interest and facilitate the timely flow of actionable information to all echelons of command. The family of systems is scalable, and tailorable to meet DHS means. The family of systems will be available to DHS as a leased service using a “power by the hour” concept.
85

Example Only
1.6.2 Support Concept
Logistics support will be managed by the family of systems service provider and shall be integrated into the existing commercial support structure. The family of systems must have a maintenance concept that provides for high reliability, maintainability, and availability at the minimum cost. The service provider will perform all maintenance with a focus on maximizing rapid transportation, minimizing repair turnaround times, and minimizing payload reconfiguration times. Standard test and ground support equipment, petroleum, oil, lubricants, line replaceable units (LRU), and repair parts will be used. Peculiar support equipment, manning, training, unique aviation fuel and facility requirements will be minimized. The service provider will be responsible for technical data, training, and procedures. The logistics support concept should maximize system availability, flexibility and self-sufficiency. Stages of various levels of contractor support may be required prior to Initial Operational Capability for each increment to provide supply and maintenance technical support during the build up phase. For operations in sensitive environments, DHS users must have easy and reliable sustainment capability for both austere operations and airfield operations.
Supply support will be accomplished by the service provider (Threshold). Contractor supply data systems must provide DHS users total asset visibility throughout the supply chain and meet the protocols for, and interface with any DHS or other government agency supply data system (Threshold). The service provider will provide personnel to support operations from existing DHS facilities, and deployable contractor manpower positions, if required. Supply/resupply methods will not require additional reporting procedures. To the extent possible, parts should be properly configured with current software and delivered with all proper seals, gaskets, pneumatic, and electronic interface connections installed so they may be directly connected in accordance with the appropriate technical orders. The service provider is responsible for shipping mission critical parts originating from the contractor facility to any location supporting DHS operations. Required parameters for United States deliveries: 48 hours (Threshold) from supply system requisition to delivery of parts to aircraft, 24 hours desired (Objective).
2 Threat
The persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) family of systems will face a wide array of threats during operations ranging from humanitarian operations like disaster relief, to low-intensity operations like supporting CBP, to high-intensity operations like response to a terrorist attack. As an attritable asset, the family of systems may execute missions in higher risk scenarios (e.g., CBRNE exposure) than a corresponding manned platform. Possible threats to the family of systems range from small arms (e.g., looters/rioters) to surface-to-air missiles (SAM) including man portable air defenses (e.g., terrorists), fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, directed energy weapons (to include lasers and radio frequency weapons), nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) weapons, and information warfare. The most severe threat to the proposed family of systems will be a combination of these diverse systems, with the degree of severity being mission scenario dependent. In addition, terrorism and sabotage are also threats at all operating locations. Ground control stations are subject to the same
86

Example Only
threats as other assets at the location they are operating from but could be a higher priority for a surgical attack depending upon other collocated assets.
3 Existing System Shortfalls
Of all of the DHS agencies addressed by this ORD, CBP is the most advanced with four MQ-9 UAVs, building to an eventual fleet of 20 aircraft supporting both the southern and northern border. However, in the event horizon for this ORD, there remain critical gaps in ISR coverage that could be filled by utilizing the persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) family of systems capability. The USCG is now partnering with CBP to investigate using MQ-9 UAVs in support of maritime ISR in the southeast region of the United States. Even with this assist from CBP, USCG currently has no deployable ISR assets for their fleet. The persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) family of systems can close this critical gap. Likewise, FEMA must rely on other government agencies to supply ISR support in response to natural or man-made disasters. The persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) family of systems would provide FEMA an in-house disaster response capability. Finally, ICE would benefit from the use of the persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) family of systems supporting intelligence collection on high profile criminals and terrorists in support of their mission.
