abstract
Given the recent trend in Data Science (DS) and Sports Analytics, an opportunity has arisen for utilizing Machine Learning (ML) and Data Mining (DM) techniques in sports. This paper reviews background and advanced basketball metrics used in National Basketball Association (NBA) and Euroleague games. The purpose of this paper is to benchmark existing performance analytics used in the literature for evaluating teams and players. Basketball is a sport that requires full set enumeration of parameters in order to understand the game in depth and analyze the strategy and decisions by minimizing unpredictability. This research provides valuable information for team and player performance basketball analytics to be used for better understanding of the game. Furthermore, these analytics can be used for team composition, athlete career improvement and assessing how this could be materialized for future predictions. Hence, critical analysis of these metrics are valuable tools for domain experts and decision makers to understand the strengths and weaknesses in the game, to better evaluate opponent teams, to see how to optimize performance indicators, to use them for team and player forecasting and finally to make better choices for team composition.

1. Introduction
Players’ performance prediction by using current and past data has gained attention, particularly in basketball [1,2]. Sports analytics and forecasting through these data is a rapid growing field with many methods that can be implemented from a different perspective for each situation [3]. In a team, and specifically for the technical staff and coaches, the knowledge of advantages and disadvantages for each player can give an added value in roster composition, in new transfers, in changing the rhythm during a match and other vital qualitative and quantitative factors [4]. The aforesaid Performance Analytics are critically valuable for a team, in order to minimize budget costs, maximize team value and improve the processes in all layers and segments of the flow [5].
In addition, many teams and countries invest large amounts of money to train athletes who can win competitions, Olympic Games etc. Over the last few years, basketball analytics began to have bigger traction and attempt to analyze the game in more depth by finding advanced analytics to optimize team and player performance [6]. New technological findings can give the opportunity to collect more data and requiring new methods of analysis

to be performed. Therefore, the new analysis methods could exploit and generate these added values for defining the basketball players behavior and help the technical staff and coaches in better decision making [7].
Generally, sports data are irregular and sparse. They are sparse because the majority of the players do not have long careers, and do not remain in the same league and/or team for many years. The data are not regular because the career of each player belongs to different chronological periods [8]. The big variety of sports data such as shots attempted, fouls committed, the defense metrics during the game and the kilometers they run, and many other parameters of a game can be tracked with the use of SportVU cameras. However, it is significantly difficult to distinguish the dominant performance analytics of each team/player in comparison with the opponents’ performance as well. There are outlier factors, such as the psychological or physical condition of each player/team that can be analyzed and give an extra important information for decision making [9]. These are recognized electronic devices named Electronic Performance and Tracking Systems (EPTS) that can measure all these additional data through the gyroscopes, magnetometers and accelerometers sensors that provide opportunities to explore all these significant aspects in more depth [10].
This research attempts to gather all the proper analytics used in sports as state-of-the-art performance indicators through sports data in decision making for basketball games, teams and

players. Data mining is looking for unknown structure and data analytics [11,12]. Hence, this could help decision-making and predict uncertain data [13]. In conclusion, sports analytics could be very helpful to educate the next generation of players, technical staff and managers. The teams can take advantage of them for future prediction of roster composition, optimization of tactics and avoiding unexpected circumstances [14,15].
The structure of this paper follows:

2. Background
2.1. Terminology
This section focuses on key terms required to understand this paper.
Sports Analytics The term ‘‘Sports Analytics’’ also referred as ‘‘Statistics in
Sports’’ in the bibliography comprises the segment of data collection and management, predictive modeling and computational methods in order to find valuable information for sport related decision making [16].
Alternatively, Sports Analytics is a scientific field that deals with the collection and analysis of past and current sports data [17]. This collection combines and applies methods that can give an added value to a player or a team. Through this gathering and investigation these metrics can give a qualitative analysis to owners, players, coaches and team staff in order to help them to predict future situations or make suitable decisions.
Sports data can be either qualitative or quantitative and come from different sources such as boxscores, videos, demographical, medical and scouting reports. Data collection should be standardized, integrated and analyzed through different basketball analytics in order to enable decision makers to take critical decisions [18,19].
One of the most significant topics in sports analytics is the identification of performance analytics in teams and players. By analyzing them there is direct impact on teams composition, on players evaluation and decision making of subject matter experts, coaches, and technical staff [20].
Recently, there is a highly increasing trend in sports analytics, recognized as one of the hottest topics of analytics in general.

Fig. 1. Sports Analytics Skills vs. Impact correlation.
There are many web pages and blog articles, but also a scarcity in credible peer reviewed research articles. The challenge of Sports Analytics is that domain experts need to combine the scientific research experience with sports professional career (as player or coach) and understand how to critically analyze important sophisticated basketball analytics [21].
The combination and application of appropriate tactics can give an added value in a player or a team in order to implement this critical initiative to make the right decision in the right time. Through the proper data gathering and data analysis, basketball analytics can provide qualitative analysis to team owners, players, coaches, and technical staff to help them predict future situations and make the right decisions to improve their performance [22].
The required skillset and the influence in each sport is not only to describe and provide the data but to diagnose, forecast and make critical reasoning.
Fig. 1 illustrates the correlation between the influence of sports analytics based on the required skills. There is a recent trend in sports analytics to move from descriptive (sports reports) to prescriptive analytics with the purpose to understand the game in more depth. By using data modeling techniques and optimizations the technical team and subject matters can notice valuable insights and recommendations [23]. Sports analytics is also increasingly adopted by the business ecosystem in a plethora of companies, sports segments, teams, technical staff and athletes [24].
Data Mining and Sports Data Mining is the discovery of patterns or rules from large
amounts of data, as well as the process of searching for valuable information in data [11]. Therefore, it is the engagement of one or more techniques into automated analysis and knowledge data extraction. Furthermore, it is the process of data analysis in the examined datasets with purpose to solve the described problems. Sports teams use data mining methodologies either for interpretation or segmentation purposes that will finally help them in decision making. Assembling DM techniques and important information can boost a team and give a competitive advantage.
The classification of individual players or teams based on their performance can show different perceptions or ways of play. Once the preferences in each position have been decided, gameplay is set, the managers and coaching staff finally can understand, drill down and analyze insights to choose the best option for each situation. Through these advanced basketball analytics, this sophisticated approach can be personalized for each team/player preference or performance [25]. With the implementation of this concepts we can automate such procedures for optimized classification, segmentation and forecasting.

There are some sophisticated algorithms that can be used in sports analytics listed below:
(1) Random Forest are classification and regression models [26,27] and [28].
(2) Adaboost is a classification algorithm that can be extended for regression [29–32] and [33]
(3) Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a network of perceptrons, which are neurons with multiple inputs and one output [11,32] and [29].
(4) Radial Basis Function (RBF) Networks is a class of functions with the value increases\decreases based on distance of central point [34–36] and [37].
(5) Association Rule based models are algorithms that use techniques to extract relationships from hidden items through different datasets. They discussed in [13,29,34,38– 40] and [41].
2.2. Literature review
DM and ML algorithms used in sports We evaluate here multiple modeling approaches combined,
in order to provide the optimum performance rating accuracy for players and technical staff. Past research reported in the literature, have used classification methods, clustering or both. The state-of-the-art algorithms used in sports analytics based on the bibliography include the following:
(1) Neural Networks can be used for both classification and prediction purposes (deep learning, dropout) as stated in [25,26,30,34,42] and [29].
(2) Decision Trees are predictive models as described in [6,9, 23,31,37,43–45] and [46].
(3) Bayesian Networks are probabilistic classifiers (Markov Blanket) as explained in [16,30,32,38,47] and [33].
(4) Support Vector Machines (SVM) are classifier and regression analysis algorithms as referred in [32,34,37,48,49] and [30].
(5) Linear and Logistic Regression are models for team and player forecasting [8,16,50–52] and [9].
(6) Unsupervised learning through clustering is an algorithm for partitioning where the center of each cluster is displayed by the mean value of the objects [20,25,53–58] and [59].
3. Methodology – Research design
Research questions/hypothesis.
1. How does performance evaluation in Basketball Players & Teams happen? (RQ1)
2. How can these ratings, techniques and methodologies be optimized? (RQ2)
3. How to understand the impact of basketball performance analytics and identify the correlations between them? (RQ3)
4. How can we identify the dominant attributes for prediction of Most Valuable Player (MVP) and Defender of the year? (RQ4)
The answers to these questions are critical for the technical staff and coaches in order to take decisions and determine the performance and future player career trajectories with more accuracy [25].

Overall aim. Based on comprehensive analysis, the main aim of this paper is to evaluate the existing performance analytics used in Europe and NBA (in USA) basketball. Therefore, all sophisticated performance game-related analytics allow to distinguish defense, offense, overall, miscellaneous and performance ratings that exist in bibliography are reviewed. In addition, a comparison matrix is provided for these basketball analytics, trends and patterns that may have been overlooked in current bibliography.
The aforesaid analytics could give an added value to a team and can be treated as a competitive advantage [11]. In general, sports include two important variables. The first one is luck and the second is skill. Luck is something random that you cannot predict. The luck percentage differs from sport, league competition and country. For example in NBA, luck is around 35% which is really a lot [60]. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to compare performance basketball analytics with the purpose to increase the understanding of important insights and minimize the possibility of uncertain current or future events [61]. Hence, it is crucial to understand, analyze and forecast the aforementioned statistics to enable meaningful analytics and statements. Another aim of this research is to quantify player performance attributes in order to increase forecasting accuracy [61].
However, due to the complexity of sports and the huge unstructured retrieved data there is lack of specificity and context that through the help of analytics and proper analyses can exploit in more depth valuable information [3]. Performance forecasting for team and players is a common practice used in the sports industry and by betting companies by gathering data from different perspectives, related to training, matches, injury, psychological etc., and used for short/mid/long term predictions [62].
Specific objectives. It is crucial for sports teams to be able to understand the team/player performance and then in the next step to make the proper decisions [63].
An objective of this research, is to review basketball performance analytics used worldwide [8]. The paper also tries to analyze and compare on Euroleague and NBA basketball leagues in order to find useful insights in micro-level during a game and how they can use this information for critical statements [64]. For sports teams generally (especially for managers and coaches), the team roster selection criteria, it is very significant to have an insight and high-level estimation of how players selected for the upcoming season roster will perform [3]. Forecasting models applied to NBA basketball analytics with the purpose of identifying major player performance attributes to predict the future MVP and Defender of the year. In referred basketball analytics there is a clear analysis of existing algorithms used till now and we aim to verify whether these terms can be optimized. One of the objectives of this work was to predict the NBA MVP and the Defender of the year based on the existing basketball statistics (RQ4).
4. Findings
Basketball is a sport that presents a lot of uncertainty [7]. Although, there are plenty of past data, there are no advanced tools that can forecast players’ performance. Some useful metrics provided already for each basketball match are the following (RQ1):
• Plus/Minus (+/−or PM): measures the impact of a player
in a game (quality and contribution). It is the calculation or difference of points that a team scores versus the opponents scored points [50]. The problem with that metric is that it does not count the matchup between the players.

V. Sarlis and C. Tjortjis / Information Systems 93 (2020) 101562

• Adjusted Plus Minus (Adj +/−or APM): is the player statis-
tic for rating. It calculates the influence of a player with his presence or not in the team line-up [65]. In NBA is the APM is one of the dominate evaluation indicators [66].
• Real Plus Minus (Real +/− or RPM or RAPM): Included
the Real Plus Minus wins (RPM Wins) and the number of the possession’s metrics. The RPM is the net value of ORPM (Offensive Real Plus Minus) and DRPM (Defensive Real Plus Minus) for the estimated on-court influence on team performance.
• PIPM (Player Impact Plus Minus): is another version of
plus-minus metric that adjusts the box-score value with the luck adjusted plus minus data [67].
• Player Impact Estimate (PIE): calculates the overall player’s
contribution against the total stats in games that they played [68,69].
• CARMELO: focus on win forecasting topic based on players
statistics and ELO ratings. This model takes into account personal stats of wins and losses [50].
• Expected Possession Value (EPV): evaluate and quantify
values that makes a player to decide during the game [70– 72].
• Wins Above Replacement (WAR): reflects a combination
of a player’s projected playing time and his projected productivity while on the court. It is computed using the BPM variable [64]. It is the same with WORP.
• Performance Index Rating (PIR) is used in European Bas-
ketball leagues giving a view of player’s total performance [24].
• Game Score (GmSc) gives attention to any statistic detail of
player’s box score [8].
• Net Rating (NetRtg) is used in NBA for counting a team’s
point differential per 100 possessions [50].
• Pythagorean Win Percentage is an estimation that shows
a team’s win percentage based on their points for and against [4,73].
• Player Efficiency Rating (PER) is a per-minute rating. PER
sums up all a positive action of players, deducts the negative events, and returns a per-minute rating of a player’s performance [74].
• Value over Replacement Player (VORP) is a box score es-
timate of the points per 100 team possessions that a player
contributed above a replacement-level (−2.0) player, trans-
lated to an average team and prorated to an 82-game season. Multiplied by 2.70 it converts to wins over replacement (WORP). VORP is a positive\negative real-value analytic [64].
• Win Shares (WS): It is an estimation of the number of wins
that each player contributed to his team’s win overall on the season [32].
• Tendex: Statistical model to determine player efficiency of
basketball players. Considered the first rating formula by using linear weights [75].
Nevertheless, most of the metrics share similarities in measurement that intend to give a total perspective on a player’s statistical performance [38]. A great player will achieve high performance in most of these metrics. On the contrary, conventional players will show low values in all of them [25].
The aim of this research is to satisfy the increasing demand for new techniques and provide significant insights and advanced analytics for teams, technical staff and players. Players’ performance prediction depends on many variables such as psychology, injury risk [9], bad shots in the starting minutes of the match, opponents match-ups which can give important impact in future performance, but are very difficult to define and quantify [4]. Nevertheless, technical staff and data analysts need to evaluate

these metrics, monitor and track the performance and finally take important decisions for the future acquisitions or selections in a team [76].
The team line-up evaluation and final choice is critical during the game, but also before the game when structuring the strategy of the team against the opponents. LinNet is a calibrated network embedding model for line-up evaluation [65]. The quantification of each player rating in team roster and the profile building based on player style of the current season and the number possessions can drive the construction of the line-up [77].
To conclude, this work could also be combined in the future with data driven sensors methodologies in each athlete and SportVU camera data that were introduced in recent years [78]. Therefore, an integrated solution can be developed in the short future that will include advanced metrics with proper visualizations, heat maps, player tendencies [57]. Therefore, the complete solution will quantify not only game statistics, but also important behavioral metrics that depend on physical conditions as well. This information is important in order to optimize performance and can lead a team to win more games [14].
The rating KPIs (Table 1) are quite important in data analysis but can be enforced with the analysis of unexplored moves or decisions before them. This gap is important in order to understand the conceptual of players contribution to final result [71].
Based on previous researches four factors of basketball analytics with different weights assigned (eFG%, FTr, REB and TOV) show that the evaluation of them give a big impact on team and player performance [6,9,66].
5. Discussion, case study & forecasting scenario
5.1. Discussion
Tables 1–6 in the Appendix illustrate important basketball analytics that dominate the game. A clear segmentation was conducted in this paper with the objective to categorize player or team characteristics in basketball and guideline subject matters.
In Table 1 there are the crucial performance basketball analytics. USG% counts the percentage of player engagement during the time played. NetRtg determines the amount of scored points by a player per 100 possession minus the opponent same formula against the player. Win Shares (WS) is a five-part formula that examines the offensive play in a very precisely way but does not explain the defensive play in all important criteria. Regarding shooting efficiency there are effective field goal percentage (eFG%) and true shooting (TS%). Both of them are excellent basketball analytics that can better explain the shooting ability. eFG% takes has a weighted formula by adding three points while TS% takes into account all shooting categories into the counted formula. REB% calculates the percentage of rebounds that a player takes when he is on court.
The defensive criteria (Table 2) include steals and blocks as basic metrics. DefRtg is an advanced analytic that shows the difference of on court vs. off court in the defense performance of player or team. Deflections and Def Loose Balls Recovered analytics are important hustle metrics that influence the defensive game a lot. In addition, the influence on opponent shots is crucial in order to adjust the proper tactics. The aforementioned are known as ‘‘really big plays’’. In fact, they are the actions that could inspire or ignite a team as an extra boost to change the momentum and final result of the game. STL% and BLK% shows the ability of a player in steals or blocks in each team possession respectively. In addition, a successful steal or block does not let the opponent to score, but at the same time gives the opportunity for a fast break offense. BLK% considers field goal attempts (FGA) in comparison with the attempted shots in order to explain the blocking abilities.

In offense (Table 3), the basic analytics are points, rebounds, assists and the shooting percentages in each distance. The Usage (USG) rate calculates the possessions finished by a player, but there are cases of players with high usage rate while they were assisted on most of their field goals or they had on their own field goal. Additionally, a good screen to the teammate can go into an easy basket (Screen Assists metric and PTS). An offensive loose ball recovery or an offensive rebound are important because they can give an extra team possession. AST% is important because it determines the pace and volume of the game with an adjustment of the time played. Points Per Possession (PPP) explains the scoring efficiency while a player has the ball. The number of three-point field goal (3P) attempts have increased dramatically the last decade due to better defense, tactics and athletic abilities of the players. 3P capability can be recognized as a game changer because that offensive skill can be trained and evaluated in big men of a team as well. By having a benchmark between FGA/Poss, OR/Poss and TOV/Poss helps to target for high scores in offensive rebounds, increase FGA and offset turnovers. PTS/Poss has an elasticity point (as we are saying in economics) where there is a critical point between tempo and scoring in order to achieve good results on average scored points at each time that a player touches the ball during the offense.
In Table 4 there are overall categorized basketball analytics. TOV% is a rate metric that focuses on the percentage that a player makes mistakes over time while is on the court. Assists/Turnover ratio (AST/TOV) can better measure the efficiency since correlates the offensive and defensive criteria according to their possessions and it is more representative than to compare the average of assists and/or turnovers. AST/Poss and AST/FGM are important metrics because it shows how well performed each possession and turns into basket. STL/DP and OR/Poss should have higher values than TOV/Poss for better performance results. Teams that have high tempo might have more TOV/G and less TOV/Poss compared with other team.
In Table 5 illustrated the comparison matrix of advanced basketball analytics. The term of NetRtg refers to the offensive and defensive rating (OffRtg and DefRtg), it is a metric that usually the team or players with the higher value are the winners but if a sports analyst uses only this criterion the evaluation of performances is not robust.
Table 6 indicates a comprehensive research with a classification matrix in Sports analytics bibliography that used DM algorithms and techniques for each purpose. Our literature verifies that Sports Analytics is an emerging scientific field that penetrates even more in Sports industry by using DS, ML and DM techniques to optimize performances and forecast in more accuracy.
5.2. Case study
In basketball and for sports in general there are many important analytics that through them we can make important decisions during or after the game as lessons learned for improvement. In order to understand in more depth, the basketball analytics referred in Tables 1–5 we provide a comprehensive analysis of different case studies of Top5 NBA basketball players in the 2018–19 season. According to the most notable analytics these players are Giannis Antetokounmpo (MVP of the year), James Harden (top scorer of the year), Paul George (key player in many categories), Stephen Curry (most efficient shooter) and Rudy Gobert (Defense player of the year) [79]. This research shows the most remarkable achievements of each player of the season with the purpose of benchmarking them across the most significant basketball analytics.

• Giannis Antetokounmpo: he had high scores in the majority
of basketball analytics and lead in WS/48 (0.292), PIPM (7.8), PIE (21.8), EFF (35.3), PER (30.9), PACE (105.27) AST Ratio (19), PFD (7.7). Based on high performance in these categories took the award of MVP for the year 2018–19.
• James Harden: he had high skills in scoring and perfor-
mance analytics such as PTS (36.1), AST (7.5), AST% (39.4), td3 (7), WS (15.2), BPM (11.7), GmSc (16.9), PRA% (64.36), FP (58.7), VOPR (9.9) and USG% (39.6). He was the real competitor for the MVP title.
• Paul George: he was valuable key player for his team by tak-
ing lead in NBA league in performance analytics categories such as Deflections (3.8), Loose Balls Recovered (2.1), STL%, RPM (7.63) and WINS (19.9).
• Stephen Curry: he was the offensive critical point for his
team with his effective shooting capabilities. He was notable in analytics categories like AST/TO (1.88), Wins Added (18.8), NetRtg (13.7), TOV% (11.6), eFG% (60.4), TS% (64.1) and PIPM (7.4).
• Rudy Gobert: he was the defensive player of the year and
showed a big hustle for every opponent. He led in REB% (19.4), Screen Assists (6), Screen Assists PTS (13.8), dd2 (66), BLK (2.3), TOV (1.6), DWS (5.7), DBPM (5.1), DRPM (4.4), eFG% (66.9) and TS% (68.2).
According to aforesaid analysis a normalized radial chart (Chart 1) of these top5 players presents the marks of these performance basketball analytics. In addition, Table 1 indicates the ranges of average values in each metric in order to benchmark high–low values.
To conclude, the player’s nominees for the season 2018–2019 validated either in terms of overall basketball analytics or in specific categories based on analyzed remarks.
5.3. Forecasting scenario
During recent years the research community and betting companies focused on teams win forecasting instead of concentrating on player impact to the game, as well as the identification of appropriate attributes that are the most important for forecasting purposes.
We illustrate here a forecasting scenario for three basketball seasons 2017 up to 2020 (2017–18, 2018–19 and 2019–20) in NBA basketball competition. The data were retrieved from various sources [79,85,86] and aggregated into a single dataset. After that we performed data cleansing in order to get data ready for analysis and forecasting. For that reason, each season (82
basketball games = Q1–Q4) was split into four groups. The first group represents the first quarter of the season (∼20 games = Q1), the second group relates to basketball analytics for half the season (∼40 games = Q1–Q2), the third group relates to
statistics from about 60 games (Q1–Q3). Based on these analytics, our analysis provided predictions for the MVP and Top Defender nominee. Hence, 20 NBA players were selected, on condition of participating to at least 30 games per season and at least 15 min per game playing time on average for the whole season. An additional condition was that they achieved nominations in different statistical categories for these 2 seasons, as can been seen in Table 7. This table represents the awards for MVP, Best Defender, Top in Assists, Points and Rebounds and other important nominees. The final season (2019–20) is not finished yet, thus this research will put forward a prediction for the MVP and Defender of the year. In order to predict these two awards, we introduced and validated two below formulas (the data analyzed and normalized in the scale of 100).
For the 1st introduced formula, box score statistics and important rating basketball analytics selected as variables as an

It is the player’s or team’s average influence of net points different per X (100) offensive and defensive possessions.

It is intended to give a ‘‘total perspective’’ on a player’s statistical performance in a basketball game, taking into account every statistic listed on a player’s box score. Net Rating (NetRtg): calculates a team’s point differential per 100 possessions. On player level this statistic is the team’s point differential per 100 possessions while he is on court. PER calculates all positive and negative accomplishments in per minute rating of player and team performance. Player Efficiency Rating is the overall rating of a player’s per-minute statistical production. The league average is 15.00 every season. - pace adjustment = lg_Pace/team_Pace - estimated pace adjustment = 2 * lg_PPG/(team_PPG + opp_PPG) - aPER = (pace adjustment) * uPER
PIE measures a player’s overall statistical contribution against the total statistics in games they play in. PIE yields result which are comparable to other advanced statistics (e.g. PER) using a simple formula.
It is a metric primarily used in European leagues that attempts to calculate player or team performance.
Pythagorean Win Percentage is an estimation that shows where a team win percentage based on their points for and points against
Player’s estimated on-court impact on team performance, measured in net point differential per 100 offensive and defensive possessions. RPM takes into account teammates, opponents and additional factors

Explanation
PIPM is a Plus-minus metric that adjusts the luck part with box-score data. These 3 components are: box-score prior, luck-adjusted on-off data, and luck-adjusted net rating. It is one of the first formula for performance calculation. Tendex is the summary of positive and negative efforts
The number of possessions a player is finishing per game.
The estimated number of points a player adds to a team’s season total above what a ’replacement player’ (for instance, the 12th man on the roster) would produce. A box score estimates of the points per 100 TEAM possessions that a player contributed above a replacement-level. (RL is −2.0 of an avg team of 82 game season)
It is the combination of on court Rtg, the PIMP above a replacement level (RPL)
Win Shares is the sum of offensive and defensive Win Shares
An estimate of the number of wins contributed by a player per 48 min The number of possessions a team uses per game. Pace factor is an estimate of the number of possessions per Minutes Played (MP) by a team. The % of tactic plays in a player used while on the floor
It captures the effect of shooting percentage if we accounted for free throws and 3-pointers. The factor 0.44 can be adjusted based of linear model of past seasons. The percentage of possessions that end in a turnover The number of possessions played by a player or team. The number of possessions that played divided by the played games One of the recognized Four Factors. The % of missed shots that a player rebound. (Rebounding Percentage)
The average of player with points, rebounds and assists per game

Player

(Win%−RL) * (Min/48) Where: Win% = TmOffRat∧14/(TmOffRat∧14 + TmDefRat∧14)

The evaluation of player performance of him and four average players of his team compared with the opponent team with four average players and a replacement level player.

Figs. 2 and 3 show the forecast, according to API, for the MVP for the years 2017–18 and 2018–19, respectively, which can be verified and cross-referenced with Table 7. Fig. 4 illustrated the forecast for the MVP in year 2019–20. In Fig. 2 (Season

2017–18), James Harden in the whole season (Q1–Q4) had the best performance, in term of API formula and took the MVP award. For Fig. 3 (Season 2018–19), Giannis Antetokounmpo voted as MVP and verified his performance (76.5%) in API scale.

Fig. 2. API forecast for 2017–18.
During our analysis for Season 2019–2020 (which is in process right now) API formula predicts that Giannis Antetokounmpo has significant advantage for the MVP award against the second James Harden (77.8% versus 67.4% respectively) in Q1 up to Q3 of the regular season.
The 2nd introduced formula focused as defensive criterion for the selection of the Defensive Player of the Year, the basketball analytics variables selected implies the equation of Defensive Performance Indicator (DPI):
DPI = BLK − BLKA + PFD − PF + STL + Deflections + LooseBallsRecovered − TOV + ScreenAssistsPTS + AST /TO

Fig. 3. API forecast for 2018–19.
Figs. 5 and 6 verified the forecasts with the actual results of Table 7, while Fig. 7 shows the expected result for the 2019–20. In Fig. 5 Gobert and Davis shared the same highest score in DPI scale but Gobert voted as the Best Defender of the year 2017–18. For Fig. 6 (Season 2018–19), DPI formula verified that Gobert was the Best Defender. In the last Fig. 7 (2019–20 from Q1 up to Q3), DPI predicts that Gobert with 92.8% is the highest candidate for this award for the regular season.

Explanation The % of teammate’s FG that a player assists when is on the floor 100*AST/(((MP/(TMP/5))*TFG)-FG) AST = Assists, MP = Minutes Played, TMP = Team Minutes Played, TFG = Team Field Goals, FG = Field Goals The number of turnovers committed per 100 possessions. One of the recognized Four Factors. 100*TOV/(FGA+0.44*FTA+TOV) 100*(TRB*(TMP/5))/(MP*(TTRB+OTRB)). It is a weighted average of total rebounds a player took while he was on the floor. It shows how well passed the ball through the game. The number of assists that goes to a made basket The number of shots attempted and blocked by a defender The number of double-digit number total in two of the five statistical categories in a game that a player achieves The number of double-digit number total in three of the five statistical categories in a game that a player achieves The free throw shot attempt per every possession.

- Based on the development of APM and uses in more detail aging curves and Bayesian priors. - One of the most important basketball indicators till now - It is simple and understandable analytic
- Can be used either single game or season
- Each team correlated with ranking based on expected wins - It is a good way to rate teams and use it for future projections
- It was started as a fantasy sports analytic for performance evaluation. - It is ideal for competition with long regular season because the statistics could be normalized
- All statistics are weighted differently based on frequency that they occurred - Positive and negative coefficient according to the contribution

NetRtg

- A normalized metric of defensive and offensive over 100 possessions can count the ability to count the pace of teams or players

PACE
PER (Player Efficiency Rating)

Shows how controlled is a team or a player since a faster pace can give more possessions\opportunities through a game.
-Performance rating by calculating positive and negative accomplishments per minute -Accounting the team’s pace comparing to league average

PIE PIR
Pythagorean Win Percentage

PIE is quite similar to PER logic by calculating the per minute offense production and defense categories.
PER representing the performance with focusing in per-minute contribution and pace adjustment. Hence, can easily compare normalized performances between team and players
- Estimation of Win Percentage based on Point for and Points Against

Disadvantages - Do no show the solely impact of a player in the scoring - Poor handling of offense outliers - Poor handling of block shots - Not good defense rating - Overvalue players with high values of USG and REB - Do not show the specific player ability as an individual apart from team impact. Some coaches also select some player duos or trios frequently - High variance even with the use of regression with different roles, coaching tactics, teammates and matchups - The increment of data do not decrease the statistical significance- Do not have extra info for player tracking or play by play stats - Bloated variances due to a non-invertible distribution of players - Based only in scoring factor and impact of each player compared to a league average of players per 100 possessions.
- Focus on box score data of a game - Does not have any specific weight of a statistic category - ELO calculation focus only teams rating and cannot count players rating
The weights that set sometimes can give advantage in some categories, can be disadvantage in other statistics.

Multiple regression model
Linear regression model with a weight played on the square of the coefficients
Linear formula
Linear regression model with weights
Linear formula with specific weights

- Do not apply to seasonal statistics - Do not show the specific player ability as an individual apart from team impact - In shooting categories the player should have 57% for breakeven - Focuses on player efficiency
- The estimation of number of possessions can give different results or forecasting. Sometimes there is a bias in the presented results, and this can drive into undesirable comparisons of players or teams. - Overestimation in possessions can drive into underestimations in ratings.
Do not give attention into multivariate factors for better player or team performance estimation
- Does not count any other parameter other than steals and blocks. - Rewarding the inefficient shooting. Two points field goal made worth 1.65 points and three points field goal made worth 2.65 while missed costs 0.72 points. Hence, the shooting value could be break even in 30% 2points shots and 21% for 3points. - A player who shots more with the aforementioned results can gain better PER - Non logical phenomenon of extra high performed PERs in extremely limited minutes
- It captures many parameters but cannot explain in depth how performed well a player or a team. - There is arbitrage in PIR weights calculations
- The logic is similar with PIE with having different weights under considerations - PER fails to identify the most accurate value due to the fact that the weights are arbitrarily calculated

- Measuring the impact of shooting efficiency of three points added value

Disadvantages
As all weighted formula focuses in specific criteria of the game. This approach can boost some teams or players and underestimate some others.
- TS% is biased in terms of FTs and underestimates the number of scored points per possession - A proposed formula for precisely calculations could be: PTS/ POSS with an FG/FTA
Measuring only the shooting performance of players without adding other important factors

WAR (Wins Above Replacement) VA

- Based on BPM as an enhanced version and convert through the calculation into the estimate of overall contribution
It is a differentiation of Plus Minus metrics by measuring the influence of possessions
- The comprehensive evaluation in offensive play of single player - Better evaluation of a single player due to the division of the minutes played - It offers a model of marginal offense per marginal points per win as a contribution result for the victory - Based on expected Pythagorean Win Percentage rather than actual wins.
- It is a forecasting analytic in a continuous manner that helps in decision making - It is a framework for basketball analytics that can overcome conventional box-score metrics
- Shows the importance and in which way can each player or team acts - All these metrics associated with team success -Based on researches the accuracy level is 94% on average
- Make projections based on past and current data based on RPM and BPM and for defense by adding the DRAYMOND metric - It is a blend of latest used analytics for team and player performance
- Players can be rated on per-minute basis accounting winning value - Replacement level metric evaluates the performance based on minutes played
- Normalizes the sum of positive and negative contribution by introducing the factor of RPL and focusing on PER analytic factor.

- Correlated with replacement player factor
Extra or less possession through the games can impact game result - Being part of a good team implies better score in WS - Not an overall good evaluation calculation - Better evaluation take players that have big amount of time on the court
Focuses in micro-analytic for sports and related of how many possessions took a team
- These basketball analytics do not capture the winning tendencies of players and teams. - Simple logic of major factors that impact the game. Score when is possible and take more possessions when it is not
- CARMELO methodology cannot be replicated and cannot validate the accurate results of BPM and WS. - Do not account factors as injuries, psychology and work ethics
- Only box-score evaluation (does not take into account other contributions) - Assumptions in replacement level, efficiency, USG
The estimate of ’replacement player’ influence the result.

Regulation — Ridge regression (Tikhonov regulation)

Cross-validation (CV) technique. CV used in order to determine the optimal limit of minutes (that played) for the standard APM linear regression technique.

Deep Learning [55]

- K-means clustering by descriptive label in each cluster to interpret large datasets with non-sensitivity to outliers

The comparison of patterns for individual player movements on offense strategy

Markov Modeling [63,83]
Markov Model transition to Poisson point processes [84]
- Network Analysis (NA) - Neural Networks (NN) - Bootstraping technique [63]

- Markov model used for expected point calculation - Entropy is used to quantify the unpredictability - Gibbs sampler (Markov chain Monte Carlo MCMC) Modeled Two-dimensional data
- Used algorithm Latent Pathway Identification Analysis (LPIA) - Used eigenvector centrality to measure the impact (centrality or importance) of a node in the network.

The analysis of ball movement and effective unpredictability in basketball offense
By this transition, it was extended the model from spatial statistics into flexible nonparametric methods which allows complicated patterns - NA used to find the optimal path of game plays that generate the most points - NN used to forecast the results of NBA games - To count the statistical significance of players performance central scores

Accuracy Capture a diverse and comprehensive set of player movements
- ADA can be used for better performance understanding - AA shows the extremes cases through data FDA results are consistent with domain experts of sports analytics.
- NN achieved 54.7% accuracy - RNN scored 65.6% accuracy after better understanding of data
Illustrated finds repeated patterns in offensive structure in basketball teams Additional Monte Carlo simulations that there is no coach effect in a team win. 20% or 30% influence of teams’ success Reasonable ranges with the proper parameters. Due to the overfitting the model to forecast the performance degraded. By finding similar positions finder, data analysts can find easily the proper positions from different seasons. The results showed accuracy from 50% to 75% between the clusters - The complex correlation of ball movement is significant important by the results and verified by the game theoretic tactics. - Use of Gibbs sampler to predict the full posterior distributions of unknown parameters In most sports data are in two-dimensions so in general the assumption in most times will be not violated
For better accuracy used adjusted p-values to classify the outliers over\under performers with threshold of 10% to avoid bias. Some interesting results are the low importance score correlated with small p-value

In contrast, our work correctly predicted the MVP using only current data. Furthermore, we provide predictions at the quarter level, and to the best of our knowledge, there is no current method to predict the best defender. In this work, we propose API as a sophisticated formula for MVP prediction based on approved qualitative and quantitative advanced analytics by the basketball community. API was used as an aggregated model of selected algorithms that incorporate the statistical data in a way that showed 100% accuracy for the years of 2017–18 and 2018–19. For the year 2019–20, the forecast for the MVP nominee is G. Antetokounmpo according to API, and Defensive player of the year R. Gobert based on DPI.
6. Conclusion & future work
6.1. Conclusion
Basketball is a team sport and that means the significance of analytics is not only to distinct the most efficient players and

teams but also the optimal combination on pairs of a team with purpose to optimize the performance on the court [63].
Team rotation is also momentous in player selection. Hence, a team has a roster of 12 players that they are ready to be productive and efficient for each minute that they play. The new coaching trend shows that the technical staff desires 12 eligible players to be ready in each match. Over the last years there is award for the 6th player and that means the bench players can make huge difference during the game. Therefore, the proper balance of team rotation and roles distribution is a key factor for the team success and here is a huge difference in that approach comparing with the previous decade [92]
The quantification of uncertainty or luck cannot be underestimated. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the most important rating parameters in basketball and minimize the uncertainty. In addition, clutch factor which is the ability of a player to take correct decisions in critical moments or under pressure in the last seconds of a game. Hence, it is an analytics with big percentage of bias and difficult to predict [88]. Specifically,

the exploration of different sports analytics and after that the evaluation of them can boost and give extra value in the decision making in order to understand in more depth each sport.
Currently, APM and PM are the most efficient performance indicators. Especially APM uses regression model to calculate the impact of teammates and opponents while they were in the court but they do not take into account the matchup with players and their opponents [66]. In addition, both techniques (PM and APM) affect overfitting which cannot analyze circumstances of players that appeared very frequently on the floor with those who appeared very rarely.
Line-up roster selection and five players basic roster of a basketball team cannot be based only in analyzed metrics such as APM, RAPM, LinNet method and other referred analytics. This analysis is difficult to forecast accurately because there are many qualitative indicators and players skillsets that cannot specified easily. In addition, the prediction of specific matchups can take place with remarkable accuracy for few minutes but cannot remain in these high levels for a whole match [65]. The optimal choice of a line-up is very complex due to different combinations of players on the court, the difficult to find the best performance indicator in each position, time, play and opponent [23].
Based on the background research results illustrate that an aggregation of players\teams statistics, statistical modeling, visual

metrics (SportVU cameras analysis, heatmaps etc.), commentary or social networks metrics, biomechanics stats, training\gym stats and wearables metrics in an optimized performance formula could be the most sophisticated solution with purpose to calculate the real performance of teams and players by minimizing the bias as much as possible [52].
The enormous amount of variable resources and different sets of data increase the complexity to interpret and develop ways and patterns of better understanding. Most of the times, the domain experts and technical staff are ex-athletes that try to interpret the game and circumstances. Hence, through sports analytics with the critical explanation can leverage them to use this knowledge as competitive advantage [14].
In the case study section, we analyzed the top5 players performance with regards to selected advanced basketball analytics and validated the yearly nominees for the awards. It was shown that our method is the only one predicting the best defender and one that requires only current data in order to correctly predict the MVP. Basketball is a team game with much complexity related to several factors such as playing, coaching decisions, team chemistry, psychology, sociology, training, marketing and health so that it is difficult to estimate the greatest NBA player for each season.

6.2. Future work
Sports Analytics can be used in innumerable types, such as Social engagement, Performance biomechanics analysis, psychological and physical metrics and the aforementioned critical analysis of advanced sports statistics so that technical staff and domain experts can understand more the game and improve the processes and methodologies [9,23].
Predictive Analytics can be applied for forecasting purposes through different factors in order to understand teams and opponent’s strength and weaknesses.
In addition to the previous research a further supplementary work can pay attention into the physical, psychological or injury part of the available metrics for players and team prediction. For the technical team and coaches, it is a big opportunity to predict such bad possible situations that could cost in team performance. There is a study that focus in NBA players psychology and behavior which measure the athlete’s social networks activity and correlates with players performance for future games. Sentiment analysis performed on those online social posts in order to understand the thoughts and behavior of the players and conclude in useful reports.
Motion capture technologies it is already the trend with tremendous data collections and be able to track every team or player movement on the court in milliseconds. The game statistics, sensors’ data from wearable devices, Computer vision through SportVU cameras and aforesaid valuable information can be used as aggregated outcomes for useful statements using DM and ML techniques that could affect in a noteworthy level in sports decision [93].
Basketball is a sport of decisions and that means the team selection, the way of training, the psychological part of a player, a possession, a deflection, a pass or a shoot can give serious impact to the performance and directly as sequence to the result of a game [71]. An additionally potential future work could be the analysis and calculation of expected possession value (EPV), which rates and evaluate each taken decision during the basketball game.
According to the current research and the two suggested formulas (API and DPI), a further optimization based on empirical results can apply specific weights on each algorithmic parameter and produce the relevant results.
Finally, sports analytics of different domains can feed directly betting intelligence systems in order to forecast players and teams results for maximizing their profits and accuracy [16,62,94] and [95]. Future research will focus on the construction of a formula with combined weighted basketball ratings based on play by play data with the purpose to optimize not only the performance evaluation but also to forecast more accurate.
