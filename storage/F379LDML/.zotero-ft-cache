abstract
The sports industry utilizes science to improve short to long-term team and player management regarding budget, health, tactics, training, and most importantly performance. Data Science (DS) and Sports Analytics play key roles in supporting teams, players and experts to improve performance. This paper reviews the literature to identify important attributes correlated with injuries and attempts to quantify their impact on player and team performance, using analytics in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 2010 up to 2020. It also provides an overview of Machine Learning (ML) and DS techniques and algorithms used to study injuries. Additionally, it provides information for coaches, sports and health scientists, managers and decision makers to recognize the most common injuries and investigate possible injury patterns during competitions. We identify teams and players who suffered the most, and the type of injuries requiring more attention. We found a high impact from injuries and pathologies on performance; musculoskeletal impairments are the most common ones that lead to decreased performance. Finally, we conclude that there is a weak positive relationship between performance and injuries based on a holistic multivariate model that describes player and team performance.

1. Introduction
Analytics are very well known in Sports [1]. NBA player performance is negatively affected by sport injuries. Despite the improvement of prevention and rehabilitation strategies, injury rates remain high. Therefore, team senior management are required to estimate and reduce injury risks, while optimizing team tactics and strategies regarding workload and rest days [2]. Especially, performance forecasting for betting companies or sports clubs is highly substantial either in terms of value or improvement. Therefore, Sports Analytics help and support domain experts to predict possible dire circumstances with the purpose to reduce costs and increase team or player performance [3].
This study examines in detail basketball health data over the latest decade (2010–20) through Data Mining (DM) in correlation with player and team performance. In addition, it attempts to find commonalities by performing classification according to injury and pathology criteria. Furthermore, it shows important insights

about team injuries impact associated with advanced basketball analytics. Finally, it presents the performance impact of specific longevity injury types, through DM techniques.
Injuries constitute the biggest concern for teams, management and fans, especially for the best players, because they could dramatically affect the overall team performance [4]. The increased ambiguity in injury prediction depends on many parameters, which are difficult to recognize and quantify.
Sports participation is very popular all over the world with benefits on physical, psychological and social aspects. Regular engagement in sports has been found to enhance: (i) the musculoskeletal system by increasing muscular strength, endurance and power and contributing to the bone mineral content and density, (ii) the cardiorespiratory function, e.g. reducing the risk of coronal heart disease, (iii) mental health by promoting self-esteem and generally by improving the quality of life. A healthy and sports active lifestyle for an athlete can reduce also any association with injury in the preparation before or during the game [5]. Despite the health benefits, taking part in sports exposes the athlete to high injury risks. The occurrence of injuries on recreational and competitive athletes is affected by multiple parameters, such as the age, gender, sport type (contact or non-contact), training workload, moving patterns that each sport includes and other

important factors that are analysed further through this study [6–15].
Basketball is widespread all over the world, from recreational to professional gaming levels. Its popularity is mostly due to the NBA competition and promotion [2], as it is recognized as the top basketball competition in the world [4]. The performance of NBA players increases the popularity and the socio-economic condition of the player, the club, as well as the whole league [16]. Basketball is considered generally as non-contact game with increased physical demands, high intensity and speed moving patterns ([2] and [17]). However basketball has evolved over time to become an increasingly physical game in which contact is accepted and expected from players ([18] and [19]).
Big Data collection and information management are emerging sectors for trainers, physicians, doctors and health domain experts in Sports, but they could help in injury risk factor identification [20]. Hence, the use of biometric tracking technologies, such as accelerometer, Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), Heart Rate (HR), and Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors and wearables can help to understand player or team disadvantages and optimize the performance, reduce potential injuries and enhance the recovery process [21].
The structure of the remainder of this manuscript is as follows:

2. Literature Review — Background
Sports injuries are one of the biggest challenges in athletics for many years. The identification and risk assessment of this uncertain factor is crucial for the clubs not only for restructuring of the team selection but most important in economical ways because it costs big investments for the sport organization. Therefore, the avoidance or limitation or even the good accuracy in prediction for players injuries can lead into large cost savings and help them in their performance improvement. Through this literature review will be examined the benefits that provided through sports analytics as for important injury analytics that associated with performance, the effect in sports injuries and the illustration of most crucial injuries that influence the basketball performance in NBA the last decade 2010–2020.

2.1. Sports Analytics
Sports Analytics is an upcoming and promising segment of Analytics that combines Information Technology (IT) and Science. Its scope is to explore athlete performance based on past and current data and provide projections with purpose to improve business decisions [22]. Sports Analytics contains the processes of data collection and management, computational methods and forecasting modelling in order to utilize knowledge extracted from sports data and support decision making [3].
Domain experts, managers, technical staff, owners and players pay attention to advanced analytics with serious consideration for key decisions based on data, advanced metrics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and technology. Sports Analytics has high attention not only from sports industry but in general the whole business by using data analysis, machine learning (ML) algorithms and technology methodologies that used as a good example to apply the application of AI approaches for its purpose based on their needs [23] and [24]. Sports industry stakeholders can take significant insights regarding team and players performance through these advanced analytics with the purpose to decide faster and more accurately during tough game/season moments. Consequently, a team can increase their chances to win. Team or player performance is the outcome of many parameters such as training and condition, psychology, body and mind preparation and other important factors. The appropriate statistical analysis and critical review of findings with the assistance of the state of the art technological tools and methods are the substantial ingredients for success [25] and [26].
Generally, in sports there are many features that determine charismatic talent, including training time, past performance, sports IQ, and basic skills that can be objectively measured such as reaction time, height, hand length, wingspan, body weight and many other anthropometric or game related characteristics. For instance researches showed that players with long arms and better agility drafted higher in the NBA draft lottery [27].
Sports Businesses invest large amount of money, so every single data column is important in decision making from ticket pricing, roster selection, opponent analysis and many match day decisions [28]. Therefore, it is a sport science field that manages data retrieval as well as the analysis of past and current advanced statistics [29]. The data collection and the combination of Data Science (DS) and ML methods can be a competitive advantage for a team and player in the targeted milestones. Sports Analytics can provide quantitative and qualitative analyses to team owners, technical team staff and players with the purpose to understand in more detail the past, make proper decisions in the current situations and predict future circumstances for maximizing the accuracy of the goal [30].
Data in sports can be retrieved from multiple sources (quantitative and/or qualitative). The variety of sports data can be for example boxscores, health, injury, videos, biometric and other important metrics. Data retrieval process can be integrated, standardized, and analysed through diverse sports advanced statistics with the purpose to support decision making in critical situations [31,32].
There is high complexity in the effort to correlate and analyse different type of sports data resources, including analysis in tactics, video-tracking, roster formation, injury prediction, physical performance measurement through Electronic Performance and Tracking Systems (EPTS) [33].
2.2. Player Injuries in Sports and Data Analysis Techniques
One of the most crucial segments directly related with player and team performance are injuries. Health and injury analytics

are the vital ingredients to understand the past but also to use it for further analysis that can lead into team success. Hence, sports analytics and data can incorporate health engagement of players with analytics with purpose to avoid illness and injury in future similar circumstances [23].
Data Mining (DM) is the discovery of rules and patterns from large amounts of data, as well as the process of searching for valuable information within data [34]. Therefore, it is the engagement of one or more techniques into automated analysis and knowledge extraction from data. Furthermore, it is the process of analysing the examined datasets with the purpose to solve the described problems of performance and injuries association that will be referred in findings and discussion section. Sports teams use DM methodologies either for interpretation or segmentation purposes that will finally help them in decision making. Assembling DM techniques with important information can boost a team and give a competitive advantage against to an opponent who does not use these technological and scientific methodologies ([35] and [36]).
The classification of individual players or teams based on their performance can show different perceptions or ways of play. Once the preferences in each position have been decided, gameplay is set, the managers and coaching staff finally can understand, drill down and analyse insights and choose the best option for each situation. Through these advanced basketball analytics, this sophisticated approach can be customized and personalized for each team/player preference and/or performance [37]. Hence, the implementation of these concepts can automate such procedures for optimized classification, segmentation and forecasting.
Soccer is the innovator in prediction of injury possibility with the use of biomedical tracking and monitoring technologies with focus on parameters of workout performance, injury rate, history of injury and odds of injury. Nowadays, other sports (such as NFL, cricket, basketball etc.) understand that it is significant investment on that area because it is cost savvy factor in the long run of a team or a player career [38].
Sports business innovation can be applied in monitoring and tracking player health utilization which leads to injury deduction. Hence, athletes can prolong their careers in their maximum efficiency and performance. Best players of the team and especially all-stars invest large amounts of money for body recovery before and after the match and focus more when they suffer an injury. The career longevity of a player on that level is crucial and needs special care in terms of training, physiotherapy, diet, nutrition and everything relevant to body care. For example, one of greatest players in NBA league LeBron James spends 1.5 million dollars per year to take care of his body for training, massage, therapists, gym, appliance, chefs and other relevant costs [39].
2.3. Major Injuries that influence Performance in NBA league
The last two decades many studies have been conducted with the purpose of analysing injuries or general health pathologies that require physician referral, medication, emergency care or both, and cause game or practice being missed. The majority of the studies examined all types of injuries, as well as the general health pathologies ([17,40] and [18]), whereas some studies examined only one type of injury, like meniscal injuries ([41]), pelvis–hip–thigh injuries ([19] and [16]), facial injuries ([42]) and ankle injuries ([43]). Also, the most of the studies analysed the league injuries of all teams and players ([16–18,40,41] and [19]), but only one study included 53 NBA players [42].
In general, the data were collected through the National Basketball [Athletic] Trainers’ Association (NBTA) online database [44] for studies [17–19,41] and [45], while some authors used publicly available records [40] and [16]. The number of seasons

that were analysed and criticized in bibliography has a variety and there is a specific pattern; for example examined injuries in 1 season [40], in 3 seasons [45], in 10 seasons [17] and [16], in another study for 17 seasons [18], in [41] for 21 seasons, in study [19] for 24 seasons and in [42] for 34 seasons. In addition, the whole period of NBA season (Preseason, Regular season, Playoffs) was analysed by [45].
The injury rates were examined according to the age and anthropometric characteristics (height, weight and body mass), the player’s position, the exposure against an opponent, the body’s region, the mechanism of the injury (contact or not), the phase of the season, the days missed, the years of participation to the league, as well as the NBA experience according to the seasons [16–18,40,41] and [19]. Similarly, the injuries influence on player performance can take place based on game availability and career longevity (points, rebounds, assists, steals etc.) through playing periods of the season [16,42] and [45].
According to the results of studies, players in age greater than 30 years old demonstrated more injuries through a season [40] and [16]. Regarding the players’ position and the injury prevalence, the literature review shows that ‘‘Forwards’’ presented higher number of injuries per 1000 player of exposures, while ‘‘Centers’’ missed the most playing time [40]. Although in the adductor injuries, ‘‘Guards’’ were injured more frequently than ‘‘Forwards’’ or ‘‘Centers’’ (49% vs 25% vs 25%, respectively [16].
The lower extremity was the most common injured body area and in particular the knee, ankle and foot joints [40] and [17]. Moreover, patellofemoral inflammation was the type of injury that caused more days missed, after that ankle injuries and knee sprains follow [17] and [18].
With regards to the studies that examined exclusively one region of the human body, they have showed that in seasons 1988–1989 till 2011–2012, the quadriceps group (hip region), was the most common injured structure and had a statistically significant game-related injury rate compared with other structures. Furthermore, strains were most frequent in the first month of the season and the greatest risk of strains occurred during the player’s eighth year in the league as it shown in study [19]. One other study [16] refers that following adductor injuries NBA players returned to gameplay after missing an average of 16 to 17 days, or 7 to 8 games [16]. Correspondingly, it does not affect player performance, nor game availability or career longevity. Similarly, the facial fractures did not cause significant decline in performance regardless of operative or nonoperative management [42]. Finally, ankle sprains affected on 26% performance decline on average in NBA players with each season and this is the reason for many missed NBA games on aggregate. Most ankle
sprains occurred during games (n = 565, 71.0%) and they involved
based on contact mechanism of injury [43]. Some studies conducted research in the application of ad-
vanced ML techniques in order to make predictions for players injuries based on aggregation of box-score basketball analytics, SportsVU cameras data, player physio metrics and workload management [46].
Long missed game periods give a negative impact in players and teams performance. Therefore, a red alert in sport team’s decision makers for an upcoming injury could be very supportive in medical and economical ways. Unfortunately, injuries are caused by various random events (exogenous or endogenous) and they have high level of ambiguity for predictions [47]. Therefore, the segment of medical and injury analytics can be caused by multivariate factors, which makes it difficult for prediction. Injury forecasting is uncertain according to physiologists and sports data analyst because it can be associated with factors of sleeping productive time, psychological, social and nutrition apart from training and physical activities [23].

3. Methodology — Research Design
This section introduces the key research questions, states the aims and objectives, and outlines the applied methodology. This study focuses on associating injury statistics with advanced basketball analytics. DM techniques were used in order to classify various non-homogeneous attributes resulted from data collection into distinct and well explained categories. In addition, the manuscript aimed to recognize insightful health and injury analytics in terms of performance during a period of 10 years.
3.1. Research Questions
1. Which were the most common types of general health pathologies and injuries in the NBA league, during the last decade? (RQ1)
2. Which teams and players suffered from the most injuries? (RQ2)
3. How did injuries affect NBA player and team performance from 2010 up to 2020? (RQ3)
4. Which are the key Data Science methods used for injury analysis? (RQ4)
The answers to the above research questions are crucial for club owners, team staff and domain experts in decision making, roster formation and budget control and/or investment, with the purpose to be more proactive through the association of advanced basketball and injury analytics [37].
3.2. Aim and Objectives
The main aim of this research study is to attain insights based on the correlation of basketball performance analytics with injury analytics. Due to the complexity of sports and the huge amounts of unstructured data retrieved, there is a lack of specificity and context, which can exploit valuable information in depth, through the help of analytics [48]. Team and player performance forecasting by gathering data from different perspectives (training, matches, injury, psychological) is a common practice used by the sports industry and betting companies, and can be used in short/mid/long term predictions [49].
It is crucial for sports teams to be able to understand team/player performance and make appropriate decisions [50]. An objective of this research, is to review basketball performance analytics used worldwide [51] associated with injury perspective or influence. The manuscript also strives to analyse NBA data in order to find useful intuitions in micro-level for players and how can this information be optimized to provide insights into the game and help decision making [52].
Based on retrieved advanced performance basketball analytics in combination with injury analytics this research targets to investigate into main and common injuries that impact on players and teams regarding their performance. In addition, the study presents which are the common injury types and which teams and players suffer most injuries (RQ1 and RQ2). Finally, the recovery time needed is significant for the team.
3.3. Methodology
The data were primarily retrieved and scrapped from various accredited basketball online sources using Python [44,53,54]. They were in a variety of unstructured, structured and hybrid data formats with qualitative and quantitative attributes. Hence, these data were combined, transformed, and analysed. Data mining techniques and state of the art machine learning algorithms were executed via the KNIME Analytics Platform and MS Excel. The

code for data scraping, and the relevant KNIME workflows and Excel files for this data analysis can be accessed on GitHub at: https://github.com/vsarlis/nbainjuryanalytics
More specifically, for the period from 2010 up to March 2020 we collected advanced performance analytics for 1298 players and 11 225 records with daily injury reports for all players in the same period. Each player’s data include position, team, characteristics (height, weight, age, origin etc.) apart from rating or performance indicators such as Net Rating (NetRtg), True Shooting percentage (TS%), Assists percentage (AST%), Steals percentage (STL%), Blocks percentage (BLK%), Turnover percentage (TOV%), Performance Estimate Rating (PER), WinShare (WS), Plus Minus (Plus/Minus or +/-) and Value Over Replacement (VORP) that are used in the literature as the most appropriate rating metrics [3, 55–57] and [58].
For the case of injury data, the situation was more difficult, because they were retrieved in raw unstructured text format with generic descriptions, with scientific medical jargon deprived of reasoning, and time series reports for basketball games. During data pre-processing we conducted cleansing, feature selection and engineering methods. This helped in depth data understanding and improvement with the purpose to make comprehensive classifications using a homogeneous architecture based on performance and injury criteria.
4. Results
Using the proposed methodology, we produced results addressing RQ1–3 in the first subsection dealing with injury data analysis side. The second subsection comparatively reviews ML and DM state-of-the-art techniques used in the bibliography.
4.1. Sport injuries in NBA league for 2010–2020 (RQ1)
During data collection and feature selection we identified 11 225 records indicating missed NBA league games by players during the last decade (2010 up to 2020). Further review of the
retrieved data revealed records related (n = 8667) and records unrelated (n = 2558) to a specific injury or pathology. The latter
group included records corresponding to decisions with regard to player injury status or their readiness for competition (e.g. ‘‘activated from or placed on injury list (IL) for rest’’, ‘‘returned to line up’’, ‘‘do not play (DNP)’’, ‘‘did not dress (DND)’’, ‘‘Day to Day’’ (DTD), ‘‘Rest’’ or ‘‘conditioning’’). From all the records indicating an injury or pathology, 3753 referred to repeated recordings of the same injury suffered by a player and were therefore excluded from further data analysis. Eventually, only 5414 records corresponded to an actual injury or pathology with 596 being related to general-health pathologies, 185 to head injuries and 4112 to musculoskeletal injuries.
The pathology or injury was either undisclosed or unspecified in 521 records (Table 4.1). The general-health-related pathologies, such as appendicitis, flu, or gastroenteritis were classified according to the main organ system affected, i.e. the
respiratory and digestive system. Other pathologies (n = 19) related to the circulatory (n = 7), the integumentary (n = 2) and the reproductive system (n = 1) as well as oral/teeth (n = 8) and ear problems (n = 1) were reported collectively in a separate
group. Several pathologies remained unclassified, as there was no indication of the affected organ system (e.g. illness, general soreness, viruses, allergic reactions). Head-related injuries were also classified according to the system organ affected that is the integumentary (e.g. lacerations), the nervous (e.g. concussions) and the musculoskeletal system organ (e.g. facial bone fractures, bruises). Finally, musculoskeletal injuries were classified according to four major anatomical areas, i.e. the neck, the trunk, and the upper and lower extremity.

A separate group of records (n = 21) consisted musculoskele-
tal injuries that occurred in multiple distinct major anatomical areas (e.g. ankle and abdominal area, upper and lower limb). Further classification of the musculoskeletal injuries in anatomical sub-areas was performed for the trunk (chest, abdominal, thoracolumbar and pelvis area including the sacral, pubic and buttock sub-area), the upper extremity (shoulder, upper arm & forearm, elbow, and hand, thumb & fingers sub-area) and the lower extremity (hip, thigh, knee, calf, fibular, shin, ankle, heel, foot, toes sub-area) with the last major area presenting in several cases injuries in multiple distinct anatomical sub-areas (Table 4.1).
All injuries were classified according to the major area or subarea that occurred based on the direct or indirect reference of a record to an injury. Direct references to a specific injury included (i) strains of a particular muscle, (ii) sprains of a specific ligament, (iii) cartilaginous damages (bulging or herniated discs, meniscal tears), (iv) subluxations, dislocations, or hyperextensions of a joint, (v) tendinopathies or (vi) bone fractures located in any of the major anatomical areas or sub-areas specified in this study. Injuries were also classified in a specific anatomical area when a record referred to an injury indirectly. Such records mainly concerned either symptoms such as pain, soreness, inflammation, muscle spasm, stiffness, tightness, bruise or swelling that occurred in a particular major anatomical area or sub-area or a method performed for specific treatment purposes (e.g. surgery to repair a herniated disc, arthroscopic surgery performed in a specific anatomical area, ultrasonic treatment to remove scar tissue).
Table 4.1 shows that musculoskeletal injuries are the most frequent ones (75.95%) followed by general health problems (11.01%), unspecified injuries (9.62%) and head injuries (3.42%).
Injury analytics classified distinct injury/pathology reasons of player absence into four different categories (health problems, organ systems, major anatomical areas, and anatomical sub-areas (Table A.2). Based on the injury classifications that applied in the collected data, they were transformed in a way to be associated with basketball performance analytics. Therefore, this correlation has showed that there is negative impact on player and team performance as injuries occurred more often.
This study examined in more detail the major anatomical areas of musculoskeletal injuries as these take up the biggest part (75.95%) of health problems in the NBA. We found, as seen in Table A.4, that ‘‘Lower extremity’’ is the most frequent type, with 69.82% of the total musculoskeletal injuries. ‘‘Trunk’’ and ‘‘Upper extremity’’ injuries are next, with 14.45% and 14.25% respectively, while ‘‘Neck’’ (0.97%) and ‘‘Multiple anatomical areas’’ (0.51%) demonstrated the lowest injury frequency. Thus, we conclusively answer RQ1 (Which were the most common types of general health pathologies and injuries in the NBA league, during the last decade?).
We also performed null hypothesis significance testing with the purpose to validate the hypothesis with RQ3 that injuries affect NBA player and team performance, correlating injury and performance analytics. Injury analytics data were categorical while performance analytics were numerical. So, the former was transformed into numerical, in order to execute Null Hypothesis testing using the Pearson model. Table A.3 presents the correlation and p-values between injury and performance analytics. According to these results, all performance variables can be considered to have weak positive relationship with injury analytics. There is statistical significance (with p-value less than 0.05) which disproves the null hypothesis, so we can accept that certain injury analytics data are correlated with basketball performance analytics. However, we cannot conclude that they are the major factor influencing performance. For example, in the case of the ‘‘Value Over Replacement’’ (VORP) performance metric in relation with health problems, we noticed minor

positive correlation (Correlation value = 0.2025 and p-value =
0), whereas the ‘‘Box Plus-Minus’’ (BPM) performance metric in relation with anatomical sub-areas shows non-relationship
(Correlation value = −0.03358 and p-value = 0.0066). Fig. A.1
illustrates the correlation matrix based in coloured correlations of injury and performance analytics.
According to the results, the hypothesis denotes strong evidence with statistical significance between performance and injury analytics, but there is minor positive or zero correlation due to the fact that the performance of players is a multivariate phenomenon. Hence, performance can be influenced by injuries, but it is just one factor out of several. Based on the aforementioned statements, we can hypothesize that team performance also has weak relationship with injuries due to the fact that players are parts of a team.
Through the analysis in team scope, the following Pareto chart (Fig. 4.1) plots the distribution of pathology and injury events of teams in the period 2010–20 in descending order of frequency. The cumulative line on a secondary axis is shown as a percentage

Consequently, San Antonio Spurs (SAS) had the most injuries and pathologies (241), while the Oklahoma City Thunder (OKC) team had the least distinct impairments (116), partly answering RQ2 (Which teams and players suffered from the most injuries?). Table A.2 shows the occurrences of player injuries based on the proposed classification derived from day-to-day injury reports. For instance, the class of ‘‘Anatomical sub-areas’’ showed that the most frequent musculoskeletal injuries in this time frame were ‘‘Knee area’’ and ‘‘Ankle area’’, with 849 and 801 occurrences respectively.
4.2. Data Mining and Machine Learning methods used for Sports Injury Analytics
Nowadays, there is an increasing demand in sports for new techniques with the purpose to provide significant insights and

advanced analytics for teams, technical staff and players. Player performance prediction is correlated with many variables, such as psychology, injury risk [62], bad shots in the starting minutes of the match, good condition and opponents match-ups. These can influence performance, but are difficult to explain and quantify, due to the high level of uncertainty [63]. Nevertheless, technical staff and data analysts need to evaluate these metrics, monitor and track performance and make important decisions for team selection or future acquisitions through scouting [64].
This part of our research provides an overview of injury analytics and correlations with performance using basketball analytics. In addition, it reviews state of the art techniques and methodologies of DM and ML in bibliography used for performance evaluation and prediction using injury associations.
Injuries are difficult to predict because they present high level of ambiguity and uncertainty. CARMELO methodology is a blend of analytics forecasting using regression models that input Real

Plus Minus (RPM) and Box Plus Minus (BPM) statistics to estimate performance. The method does not take into account attributes like psychology, injuries and ergometric statistics [3,65].
A comparative analysis of DS and ML techniques mentioned in the bibliography over the last 10 years as sophisticated state of the art methods for data analysis and prediction in injury analytics are listed in Table 4.2. We reviewed the literature on ML and DM techniques used for players and teams’ performance evaluation in correlation with injury analytics (RQ4).
In this paper we review the application of several data mining and machine learning methods and/or algorithms regarding performance and injury analytics, based on the Absence decision (Rest, DTD, DNP, Out indefinitely, and Out for season) and benchmarked their accuracy. For each technique, we assess if absence values need to be transformed from categorical into numerical ones, in preparation for execution. In addition, we partitioned the joined aggregated Performance and Injury dataset, according to the 80/20 Pareto rule [66], that is with 80% of the dataset

Information Systems 99 (2021) 101750
for training and 20% for testing. The results of this comparative analysis depicted in Table 4.3, show that XGBoost Tree Ensemble, XGBoost Linear Ensemble (Regression) and Linear Regression were more accurate in Absence prediction, based on Performance and Injury analytics.
In order to find important insights into load and rest management of teams, we attempted to explain and quantify the impact of ‘‘Rest’’ in team performance. For that reason, and the purposes of further data analysis, we excluded from the initial dataset players with playing time less than 20 min per game for each season. This can be justified, as only these players are expected to significantly influence team performance through Rest/Load management. Therefore, performance analytics clustered players into three groups, based on Rest Management, that is days of absence due to Rest.
The results of this analysis revealed that teams which do not rest their most utilized, in terms of time, players, demonstrate the lowest performance. The bottom of Table 4.4 comprises 10 teams with the worst performance: 15.21 for PER and 3.21 WS, having
BPM −0.19 and VORP 0.88. The best outcomes, with respect to
performance analytics, were achieved by teams with balanced rest management, as indicated by the middle group of 10 teams in Table 4.4.
5. Discussion
Digital platforms quantify muscular soreness, nutrition quality, sleeping quality and other Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for biometrics or physical conditions, which can be used with limited effort and cost. Hence these platforms are data repositories which can be used to identify important information for technical staff and players through ML.

This study applied pre-processing, cleansing, and aggregation methods to consolidate sports data into a single dataset containing advanced basketball analytics and injury statistics ready for analysis. Based on our results there is a strong association between performance analytics and injury attributes.
This research was conducted using a combination of data from different sources with different meanings and values; so, feature selection and data transformation were deemed essential in the process. Consequently, we identify important insights through the analysed data for teams and players analytics (RQ2 and RQ3).
Tables 5.1 and 5.2 indicate the top 30 most volatile players and top 30 ‘‘strongest’’ players in the period of 2010–20, focusing on the ‘‘out for season’’ and ‘‘out indefinitely’’ criteria. These criteria were set with suitable criticality weight. Primary weight was assigned to the ‘‘Out for season’’ attribute, as it takes players the longer to recover and get ready for action. Secondary weight was assigned to the ‘‘Out indefinitely’’ attribute due to the return to line-up being ambiguous. After that comes the ‘‘Did Not Play’’ (DNP) attribute as an indicator of a game not played. The ‘‘Date to

Date’’ (DTD) attribute refers to questionable player participation to a match. The least weighted attribute is ‘‘Rest’’, as it is not clearly associated with injury or health pathology of the athlete (RQ2 and RQ3).
Tables 5.1 and 5.2 exhibit that serious impact on top class players performance in correlated with injuries. For example, Derrick Rose (2010–11 NBA MVP) demonstrated decreasing performance (Table 5.3) having suffered from serious injuries after the end of regular season 2011–12 (Table 5.4).
Tables 5.3 and 5.5 show selected important performance rating basketball analytics ([3,67] and [23]) with the purpose to benchmark the association between injury/pathology and performance. These attributes are ‘‘avg_mpg’’ (average minutes per game), ‘‘sum_gp’’ (sum of games played), ‘‘avg_pts’’ (average of scoring points), ‘‘avg_reb’’ (average rebounds), ‘‘avg_Ast’’ (average assist), ‘‘avg_ts_pct’’ (average true shooting percentage), ‘‘avg_net_rating’’ (average Net Rating), ‘‘avg_per’’ (average Performance Estimate Rating), ‘‘avg_ws’’ (average Win Share), ‘‘avg_bpm’’ (average box plus minus) and ‘‘avg_vorp’’ (average Value Over Replacement).

On the other hand, players with few critical incidents of injuries (Table 5.2) such as Giannis Antetokounmpo, are demonstrating an increasing performance, which is not negatively correlated with the injury factor, as presented by advanced performance analytics in Table 5.5 (RQ2 and RQ3).
6. Conclusion & Future Work
6.1. Conclusion
The sports industry and Basketball in particular pays extra attention to small details with the purpose to avoid extra costs and maximize efficiency of teams and players. The objective of this work was an in-depth analysis on the relationship between performance and injury analytics. Data statistical analysis indicated a weak positive correlation between injuries and performance. This implies that injury is just one of several important variables affecting team and player performance.
This study showed that musculoskeletal system injuries are the most common injuries in the NBA. Specifically, for the 2010– 2020 period, in terms of anatomical areas, lower extremity issues, trunk and upper extremity injuries were the most frequent and

critical. This revealed insights, such as regular or critical injuries in the ankle or knee area which deserve further investigation. (RQ1).
It also examined how much teams and players suffered, as demonstrated by Fig. 4.1 and Table A.1 as well as Tables 5.1–5.5 and A.2, respectively. Analysing these data leads to the conclusion that even though performance is evidently impacted negatively from injuries, it is hard to quantify this impact as performance is affected by several other intertwined factors. Further in-depth analysis examining specific injuries or pathologies on a player per player case is proposed to achieve better estimations. For example, in the case of Derrick Rose, a 57.8% decline in performance, as assessed by the PER (avg_per) analytic, was identified from season 2011–12 to 2013–2014 after his injury. All in all, injuries and pathologies are one important parameter involved in the performance multivariate model and needs a holistic approach per player and\or team (RQ2).
Hence, there are ways to avoid health issues by understanding bodily and training thresholds, consuming resting days appropriately, optimizing the load and managing as well as understanding in more depth all the parameters that affect the efficiency of player and team performance (RQ3).

of this research indicated that teams with balanced rest\load management achieved better performance based on basketball analytics (Table 4.4).
The comparative review regarding ML and DM techniques and algorithms have shown that LASSO and Ridge regression methods are used to optimize prediction. Random Forest needs big data to achieve accurate predictions with the purpose to gain insights into avoiding injuries. Neural Networks and Pattern recognition methods identify complex correlations and patterns through injury analytics. SVM are used for game outcome prediction, based on injury information. These methods could be combined or aggregated producing for better insights and optimized accuracy (RQ4). In this research we also examined Performance analytics based on player absence from games. Result indicated that there is high accuracy with XGBoost (for Tree Ensemble and Linear Ensemble), Linear Regression and Naïve Bayes (Table 4.3).
Basketball analytics are used to optimize performance on court by identifying the most efficient players and teams, but also optimal combination on pairs of teams [50]. Team rotation also affects player selection. Hence, a team has a roster of 12 players that are ready to be productive and efficient for every minute

they play. The new coaching trend shows that the technical staff desires 12 eligible players to be ready for each match instead of old-fashioned coaching style that used 5 to 7 players for most of the game. Over the last years there is an award for the 6th player in basketball associations, and this means that bench players can make a huge impact. Therefore, the proper balance of team rotation, injury prevention and role distribution is a key factor for team success and there is a huge difference between this approach in comparison with the previous decade perception [68].
Injuries negatively impact a team’s finance. Proper player usage management, workload tracking and monitoring, rest management and recovery based on training history/status, age, history of injuries, psychology, stress acceptance can affect performance. The business understanding can be achieved with the proper analysis of data requirements and after that the suitable data transformation with purpose to model valuable information. This data modelling can give a competitive advantage to players, technical staff, scouters and team owners and can lead them

one step ahead in terms of strategy and tactics management in comparison with opponents choices [38].
Game results and championship titles are influenced by player and team management and use. Small details impact results considerably. Therefore, basketball and sports in general blend various uncertainties. Injuries is an important factor, because it is associated with playing and substitutions but also impact club finances (RQ3). Reducing this ambiguity can lead to process optimization and improved player and team efficiency [56].
6.2. Future Work
Accurate injury prediction is hard to be estimated. This uncertainty is useful to be examined in detail for future projections. It contains many parameters for research in terms of cost saving due to injuries, but more importantly in order to maintain a healthy and stable team roster [3]. Further work could seek an ‘‘injury factor’’ based on a structured form, with an ontology for injuries involving related hierarchies and taxonomy, that will help data entry, as well as injury identification and classification.

Such and ontology will help data scientists and domain experts to identify injury patterns, injury reproducibility and reasoning or important insights into new injuries.
Physiological characteristics in terms of physical and training improvement can be assisted through video data analysis to assess the movements of athletes with pattern recognition. In addition, GPS sensors and wearables can be used in more specialized and focused way for monitoring and tracking activities, in comparison with other teams and players. Metrics can be improved with the association of advanced basketball analytics, sleep patterns, health analytics and other important biometric analytics. Therefore, injury limitation could optimize athlete performance and maximize player and team efficiency [23].
Future work can focus on the psychological, physical or additional injury available metrics for prediction. The technical team and coaches could be assisted to foresee situations that could affect team performance. There is a study on NBA player psychology and behaviour, which measured the athlete’s social networks activity and correlated it with performance in future games [62]. Sentiment analysis can also be conducted on social network posts
