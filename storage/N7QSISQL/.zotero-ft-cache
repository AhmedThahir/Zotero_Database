4.0 out of 5 stars Still one of the best value ergo keyboards, not as nice as the older production MS Natural 4000.
Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2023
Verified Purchase
I put off replacing my last MS Natural 4000 for as long as I could, but all electronics do eventually die... I bought this one for myself at the beginning of 2023, and one for my wife a few years ago. Overall, the key action is nice and quick, and soft sounding. You can tell they're squishy rubber dome spring thingies underneath the keys. No annoying clacky sounds like my son loves on his mega bright rainbow keyboard that he plays Fortnite on and can't quite hit 20wpm. This one does just fine smashing 90-100wpm.

The extra function keys at the top don't all work through my KVM (not expected to), but the upper right section does. I'm not used to using them yet, but being able to trigger Win 10's screenshot function, task switcher, and screen lock from dedicated buttons at the top is nice. The separate search button works too. Audio controls don't work through KVM. The quick launch 1-2-3 (takes the first 3 items in your task bar quick launch section) buttons DO work. The KVM I'm referring to is the TESmart brand, item number B0867BPPFQ, which I think is one of the KVM values, and with the keyboard plugged into the limited keyboard port and not the shared USB port.

Other things I like vs the old MS Natural 4000: no need for a function lock key to access your F1-F12 buttons. Function row is dedicated and has no secondary function. No left/right button set below the space bar to constantly hit.

Things I DON'T like vs the MS Natural 4000: The function row is laid in right on top of your number row, so the buttons aren't as easy to find purely by feel, and sometimes I get messed up between hitting normal numbers and F numbers. The NumLock key isn't on the top left of the number pad, it's replaced by the '=' equals button instead. Odd substitution. The Caps lock key has no indicator. I realize that you'll figure it out as soon as you start typing, but passwords can get hosed without you knowing it. I think this is the biggest problem with the keyboard, to be honest.

The last issue I have is with the riser. I actually liked the high riser on the 4000 that picked up the front edge of the keyboard higher than the rear. The keyboard leaning back like the 4000 is actually better for wrist positioning, since it allows your fingers to hang down as opposed to be pointed up from the wrist pad. I'll have to add a wedge under this keyboard to bring the front up a bit.

Overall this is a good successor (is it according to MS? not sure) to the MS Natural 4000 series that I used for over a decade, especially when the price dips down to $40 or below. I'll probably keep buying this model until MS redesigns again.

5.0 out of 5 stars Ergo Keyboard
Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2023
Verified Purchase
I have tried other keyboards, and I come back to this one. I have an original one from when they 1st came out and it just will not quit. It is slightly larger than this one, but this, the keys are easy to push, not to noisy, the wrist pad is soft. They only thing that it needs are feet on the back. I prefer to have my keyboard raised just a bit in the back for a little bit more of a slant, this one does not have that, so I just lean it up on my laptop and that works just fine. Overall, I would recommend this keyboard, plug and play, no software or drivers to install. It is wired, but if that doesn't bother you, it is a good value, nice keyboard.

Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2023

Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard - Black. This product is ok and meets out needs. Offered for reasonable price. Used for few months only. The cushion it has fading the color as had become gray on sides where palm is rested while typing. Not sure how to clean or retain the cushion color over the period of it's use. Keys are ok. Some other reviewers mentioned, the lettering will fade over time. Will observe how it holds up overtime.

5.0 out of 5 stars Relieved lots of wrist pain! Never going back to a regular keyboard again.
Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2023
Verified Purchase
I haven't been diagnosed with full blown carpal tunnel syndrome (not yet) but using a regular keyboard or mouse with my right hand hurts my wrists. This keyboard immediately alleviated much of the pain. I am in college and have to type a lot. This is my first ergonomic keyboard and I will never go back to a regular keyboard again, although I heard the "Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard for Business" might be better.

4.0 out of 5 stars Why We Can't Have Nice Things
Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2022
Verified Purchase
I was disproportionately inflamed upon receiving this keyboard and using it for the first few hours because of the reviews I had read about this keyboard, living under the shadow of the now extinct 4000 keyboard. The keys were factory slick (like actually slippery), impossibly small for my King James hands, and I did actually encounter several of these missed keys others have mentioned.

However, you'll be pleased to hear that on behalf of my incredibly dry african hands, I have managed to shave off the smooth keys and I genuinely feel some normalcy typing as I long for what we can no longer purchase. Truly, this keyboard is not as good as the GOAT msft 4000 keyboard, but it is a... somewhat worthy successor. It feels very good, from an ergo perspective, and with time, you do get used to some of the aggravating aspects of this keyboard, mainly the tiny keys which are also smashed together, most notably the F keys. You will enjoy disabling random elements of software and spend hours wondering what key you hit.

Perhaps the designer envisioned excellent world where we are no longer intimidated by buttons that must be hit precisely, in the event that an alien race appears in our world with fascinating new puzzles that threaten our way of life if we do not finish sequences with compete accuracy. IDK

Nevertheless, if there were a world where amazing products suddenly snapped out of existence and were replaced with husks of their former selves, it would be this keyboard. Oh, right. That is this world.

4.0 out of 5 stars The original was better...
Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2023

Due to keys being close together and very few tactile clues, fingers get lost on the keyboard too easily. The original had spacing clues to let you know where your fingers were on the keyboard, I miss that A LOT... I still have to LOOK at the keyboard periodically to cover the whole keyboard effectively.

5.0 out of 5 stars Great ergonomic keyboard
Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2023
Verified Purchase
Bought this keyboard for work as I’m getting older and wrists are starting to hurt. This has greatly eased the pain in my wrist when I type for too long. What I really like is the base lift that you can attach so it raises the wrist but the fingers drop down a little lower. This is more comfortable for me.

3.0 out of 5 stars A Solid "B" Effort; but the 4000 is Better
Reviewed in Canada on September 3, 2020
Verified Purchase
So I've read a lot of the reviews on this keyboard, looked at the Logitech competition, tried without success to find a 4000 to replace my broken one; and ended up ordering this one anyways.

The Good:
- It's better than a standard keyboard; I've been typing on MS Ergonomic keyboards since 1995 because my Dad has arthritis and was told by his doctor to try this out. He replaced our family keyboard and told the rest of us to deal with it. 25 years later; it's all my family uses
- It wasn't terribly expensive. It's not a $20 toss in keyboard from Dell; nor is it a $200 Logitech ergonomic keyboard (that still doesn't have backlight / mechanical / anything really fancy besides their wifi features I don't care for or need).
- It came quickly from Amazon as expected
- It was under $100
- It still has positive lift in the front; which after getting it with the Wireless Desktop and then 4000, I can't live without

The Bad
- The key location changes (moving delete, print screen, the menu key (which no one uses ever), were pointless. A wider ALT key would've been preferred
- It has no backlighting, I don't need this as I'm a 100% touch typist, but people seem to like it
- Mechanical Keys / RGB would be sweet; but I know that's not Microsoft's thing.

The Ugly
- The wider layout mimics the sculpt keyboard, and probably uses similar moldings at the factory; but I prefer the tighter 4000 layout
- Microsoft got rid of the 4000 wired for no real reason
- It still doesn't have great Mac support; thankfully 3rd party apps help make most of the feature keys usable

** Bottom line from a IT guy who's been typing on Microsoft Ergonomic keyboards for 25 years and probably used every model there is in the lineup: **

Its not the 4000, it changes the key layout unnecessarily; it will take some adjustment; however if you want an ergonomic keyboard; and don't want the laptop style keys of the Sculpt or the "gets dirty instantly" like the fabric on the Surface keyboard - this is basically your only option.

Not perfect, but it's all we've got without eBay hunting for used options (gross).

2.0 out of 5 stars A downgrade from the original Microsoft Natural Keyboard 4000
Reviewed in Canada on September 5, 2020
Verified Purchase
The 'replacement' keyboard which is nearly double the price has less functionality, such as a middle scroll wheel. The function keys are crammed extremely tight above the number keys, unlike the 4000 series keyboard.

My N key constantly sticks where I have to prod it up even on day one. Microsoft has extremely missed the mark on this keyboard and this is my worst purchase for 2020 by far.

I would stick to the Microsoft Natural Keyboard 4000 and forget about this cash grab product, the quality is subpar, you get reduced functionality and it just isn't a comfortable keyboard.

I was using Microsoft 4000 ergonomic keyboard and it gone bad. I was looking for a replacement. Since 4000 is not available, I went with this model. This model is not at all good. As soon as I started using it , I started getting pain in my shoulder and had to stop using it. Since I had no option , I started using ordinary keybaord and it is much better than this expensive kb.

3.0 out of 5 stars 100% not for 10 fingered typer.
Reviewed in Canada on January 17, 2022
Verified Purchase
I miss the older style Microsoft ergonomic. I'm such a fast and accurate 10 finger typer. I've been using this keyboard for a couple weeks now and some of the buttons are off their usual spots. The backspace and delete button upper right is so awkwardly near each other and throws me off repeatedly. The rise in the middle of the keyboard is too tall. I'm in need of F3 and Y together in my job for a lot of the day. Believe me when I say that this function is now impossible ergonomically. I find myself looking at the keyboard more than I used to, and my accuracy has declined. I've never had this happen with any keyboard before. I also dislike that the wrist rest has been rounded off and shortened at the number pad. It should have been the same all the way across. The makes me the most upset about this keyboard as I live on the 10-key number pad all day.
A couple of pros, the emoji button is fun in Teams, the space bar is nice and big, the fact that it's USB plug-in is incredibly helpful, this keyboard is as wide as I wanted it at 19", like the old model, and the wrist rest is actually super comfortable but also can be wiped down.
I do have to say that I spilled a half cup of water right on the keyboard. I poured the water out of it, dried up with paper towel as best I could, and it still works like a charm. I picked out one of the keys with a key picker to soak up some of the excess water and I like how under the keys is flat so the keys actually hide the mechanical parts. The design did save me when I mistaking knocked the cup of water over in to the keys.

All in all, I will be shopping for a new keyboard and this will go in to storage maybe next year.
I need Microsoft to make a backlit version of their old style ergonomic, so the keys are lit up too. That's my ultimate goal keyboard...proper ergonomic, 19" wide with no unnecessary keys at the top, backlit including the key characters being lit. I was hoping this keyboard would take away my want for the ergonomic backlit since they're hard to find or so incredibly expensive, but the function of it is just poor for 10 finger typers.

2.0 out of 5 stars Very Ergonomic but flawed for professional touch typers - Bad Design
Reviewed in Canada on August 6, 2020
Verified Purchase
I can touch type which means I type without looking at the keyboard. This newer MS Ergonomic keyboard model makes it harder for me to touch type because of the flawed layout, as I keep missing keys that I would not otherwise, and find myself having to find keys sometimes by looking. But slowly my hands and fingers are getting used to the new keys positions and missing less, but some keys that I am very used to using like the Enter, Backspace, Home, End and Ctrl etc buttons, are badly positioned and are either too small and or require me to move my hands and fingers in a wider movement to reach. This is frankly annoying and the other model was definitely better which was the MS 4000.
