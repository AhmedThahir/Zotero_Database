These days, almost all businesses, from small online stores to Fortune 500 corporations, use data to run their operations. They manage this data using databases. Because of this, the demand for database administration experts has exploded, and because of this demand, working as a database developer, particularly an SQL developer, can be very lucrative .

In this article, we‚Äôll look at what SQL is and why you might want to learn it.

What Is SQL?

Data is a core part of many web applications and mobile apps . For example, an application like Facebook holds a user‚Äôs profile information, including data about their friends and posts. To hold this data, a database system is used. SQL is a programming language that enables programmers to work with that data. 
What Does SQL Stand For?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. Essentially, it‚Äôs a language that allows communication with databases in order to manage all the data they contain.

How to Pronounce SQL

üó£Ô∏è SQL is usually pronounced like the word ‚Äúsequel‚Äù. However, it‚Äôs a matter of preference (like gif vs. jif)‚Äîsome people pronounce it in acronym form as all three letters, like ‚Äúess-que-el‚Äù.
Database Database
Is SQL a Programming Language?

Yes, SQL is a programming language. It offers looping, logic directives, variables, and so on. However, it‚Äôs not a language in the same sense as, say, Java or C++.

SQL is considered a fourth-generation language (4GL), whereas Java and C++ are third-generation languages (3GLs).

Instead of being a programming language for building websites, apps, or software, SQL is a language that enables storing, retrieving, and manipulating data in databases.
History of SQL

SQL was first developed in the early 1970s by IBM researchers Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin. It was initially called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) and was designed to manipulate and retrieve data in IBM‚Äôs database management system, System R . 

In the late 70s, Relational Software, Inc. (now Oracle) was inspired to create their own version and introduced the first commercially available implementation of SQL.

By 1986, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) had adopted a standard definition of SQL.

How to Use SQL 

While an application might be programmed in a language like Python , PHP or Ruby, databases are not configured to understand these. Historically, databases understand only Sequel (though this has changed significantly in recent years). Because of this, learning SQL is almost a must if you intend to work in web development or app development.

Like other programming languages, SQL has its own markup. This makes it necessary for a programmer to learn SQL markup before they can use it effectively. 

Besides markup, another feature unique to database programming is the concept of tables. A database may be represented as a number of tables. Each table has its own number of columns and rows and represents a set of data.

üìö Imagine a library. We could create a database that stores data about books in the library.
Library Library

In this case, we would need only one table: 
Database Database

This table would allow us to store all the information we need.
SQL Language Elements

SQL is made up of statements that start with a keyword or command, e.g. CREATE, and end with a semicolon. 

Other SQL examples of language elements include:

    Keywords: Words that are used to perform various operations in a database, such as ADD, JOIN, VIEW, etc. Here‚Äôs a list of SQL keywords .
    Identifiers: The names of objects in the database, such as tables, views, indexes, columns, etc.
    Expressions: A symbol or string of symbols that perform mathematical operations on data.
    Search conditions: Used to select a subset of the rows from a table. Also allows you to create IF statements to specify whether a condition is true or false in a certain row or group of rows.
    Data types: As the name suggests, the type of data that will be stored inside each column when creating a table. Examples include number, string, date and time, etc.
    Nulls: Use a Null to specify that value that is unknown or missing.
    Comments: Explains sections of SQL statements.

And much more.
List of SQL Commands

There are a few frequently used SQL commands you should be familiar with for database work. When working with databases, a programmer might write commands such as:

    CREATE DATABASE ‚Äì to create a database
    CREATE TABLE ‚Äì to create tables
    SELECT ‚Äì to find/extract some data from a database
    UPDATE ‚Äì make adjustments and edit data
    DELETE ‚Äì to delete some data
    DROP ‚Äì to remove tables and databases
    INSERT INTO ‚Äì to insert new data into a database

These are just the most common commands. The more complicated the database is, the more commands you as the programmer will need to use.

These Sequel commands are used when writing queries‚Äìinquiries that allow you to operate data in databases. In other words, when you enter these commands in a database system, the system interprets the commands and processes them. The result could be, for example, a new record in the database, or the creation of a new database. 

Here are some quick SQL examples of queries:

CREATE DATABASE name_of_a_database ‚Äì creates a database;

CREATE TABLE n ame_of_a_table ( 

 column1 data_type,

  column2 data_type,

  columnX data_type );

The first query is responsible for creating a new database. For example, an app like Facebook might contain databases for each of the following:

    Users ‚Äì this database would store all the information about profiles of the users
    Interests ‚Äì this database would hold all the different interests that can be used to track the hobbies that users are into
    Geographic locations ‚Äì this database would hold all the cities around the world in which Facebook users live

Facebook Facebook

The second query (CREATE_TABLE) is responsible for creating a new table inside a particular database.

What Is SQL Used For?

Databases (and therefore SQL) are used in the technology field in almost every area where significant amounts of data are involved. Let‚Äôs look at some of the industries that most commonly use SQL. 

üí∞ In the finance industry , banking applications and payment processors such as Stripe store and operate data about financial transactions and users. Behind these processes is a complicated database, which SQL is often used for. Moreover, bank database systems have extra security requirements that call for the highest levels of risk compliance in the SQL code used.
Code Code

üéµ Music applications like Spotify and Pandora also make intensive-use databases. Among other things, Sequel databases help these apps to store vast libraries of music files and albums by various artists, operate this data to find what the user is looking for, store the data about users and their preferences, etc.
Spotify Spotify

üì± Social media platforms involve a lot of data processing. Apps like Instagram and Snapchat use SQL to store a user‚Äôs profile information such as bio and location, to update the app‚Äôs database when a user creates a new post or shares a photo, and to record messages sent from one user to another so the user can retrieve the messages to read again at a later time.

All around you, the SQL language is being used to drive these databases. From the social networks on your phone to the apps on your computer, so many pieces of software are running some version of SQL. With such universal applicability, you can see why this database programming language is such a useful tool to have in your developer‚Äôs tool belt.

SQL Database Systems You Should Know About

A database system is a program that allows a developer to work with databases with the help of a user interface. Database systems often have ready templates, builders, and constructors.

These tools make the life of a database programmer much easier. This is because such tools automate common tasks, such as cleaning up the database system.

Now let‚Äôs look at some of the most common SQL database systems. These systems are ranked based on DB-Engines popularity scores . The ranking takes into account the following variables:

    Number of mentions of the system on websites, measured as the number of results in search engine queries
    General interest in the system or frequency of searches in Google Trends
    Frequency of technical discussions about the system
    Number of job offers in which the system is mentioned
    Number of profiles in professional networks in which the system is mentioned
    Relevance in social networks

MySQL

This open-source database system is available for free to individuals and businesses. It‚Äôs highly popular with small businesses and startups since there‚Äôs no license fee. Because of its open-source model, MySQL is used in many open-source software programs and applications.

Curious about the difference between SQL and MySQL? The name can confuse some people, so when it comes to SQL vs. MySQL, remember that SQL is the language and MySQL is a database system. SQL and MySQL work together, but are completely different. You use SQL to access, update, and manipulate data stored in a MySQL database.

PostgreSQL

A major competitor to MySQL, PostgreSQL is another free, open source database system. It‚Äôs used widely by technology startups for its free licensing model. PostgreSQL supports all major operating systems‚ÄìMacOS, Windows and Linux. It places greater emphasis on following standard SQL syntax than other databases. Other databases (like SQL Server) greatly modify the SQL standard, making them harder to learn.

NoSQL

NoSQL (aka ‚Äúnot only SQL‚Äù) refers to a type of ‚Äúnon-relational‚Äù database (i.e., it does not use a schema of rows and columns found in most traditional database systems). 

While SQL databases have a predefined schema, NoSQL databases allow you to store data in many different ways, depending on the requirements of the type of data being stored. NoSQL or non-relational databases include MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, and Couchbase. (You cannot use SQL to access these databases.)
