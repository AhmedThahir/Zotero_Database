Kinesis Corporation

Kinesis Corporation was founded in 1991 with the objective of developing the first computer keyboard optimized for comfort and productivity. After extensive research, the first Kinesis contoured keyboard, the Model 100, was launched commercially in 1992. The success of the Kinesis contoured keyboard in solving intractable RSI problems has been remarkable and unprecedented.

Twenty-seven years later and Kinesis is still creating innovative ergonomic keyboards for work and recreation.

The Freestyle design is backed by extensive research and testing

For 7 months the Atlas IPS firm conducted an independent study investigating the impact of the Freestyle keyboard’s unique split design on posture, comfort, and performance with 80 employees at a large U.S. software company.

Findings:

    100% were back to full productivity after a brief adaption period
    96% preferred the Freestyle over their conventional keyboard
    79% experienced a decrease in neck discomfort
    50% experienced a decrease in ulnar deviation

5.0 out of 5 stars A fantastic upgrade to your Ergonomics
Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2022
Color: 9 Inch Separation Verified Purchase
Last post I wrote about the Kinesis Freestyle Edge RGB Keyboard, an ergonomic gaming keyboard that is nice but expensive. Know that if you are purchasing the Freestyle Edge, you are paying for the luxury of RGB backlighting. You can see my full review of the Freestyle Edge here. For a more affordable option, consider the Kinesis Freestyle2.

Before I begin, I would like to mention that I am not a doctor, and this review is based on my personal experience. For medical advice, always consult a doctor. This is not a paid review, but I will be using affiliate links to the products. If you choose to purchase anything I recommend, I get a small commission if you buy using my links. It isn't much, but every little bit helps.

The Kinesis Freestyle2 is a wired split keyboard designed for ergonomics. The keyboard comes in a nine-inch split and a 20-inch split variation. I have the nine-inch split version, and I don't feel like I need any more. Plan for your setup. I have wide shoulders, and the split design has allowed for a more comfortable position.

My only complaint about the Kinesis split keyboards is that they do not come with the optional tenting kit. Kinesis offers an optional tenting kit for all their split keyboards for a more ergonomic experience. I used the Freestyle2 without the kit, but I am so used to the tilt that I had to buy the kit for this one as well. Most people should be fine using the keyboard without the kit, but personally, the tenting kit makes long typing sessions a lot more comfortable. The Freestyle2 has two options for tenting, a 15-degree variant ($40 on Amazon) and a 90-degree variant ($200 on Amazon). I use the 15-degree variant and think it is perfectly fine, but the 90-degree is a solid option if you prefer a vertical keyboard. I don't have any experience with the 90-degree version and can't speak on how sturdy it is.

The main differences between the Freestyle Edge and the Freestyle 2 are the switches and backlight. The Freestyle2 is a membrane keyboard with no backlight and it honestly doesn't need either. The key presses are soft and responsive, but they aren't customizable. I have been using this keyboard regularly for two years and haven't seen any visible signs of wear and tear. Unfortunately, Kinesis doesn't offer keycap replacements keycaps or mac conversions for this keyboard. The Freestyle2 also comes with a few preprogrammed macro keys for productivity. I haven't found too much use for these with my workflow.

I used to use a cheap flat keyboard for work that left my hands useless by the end of my shift. There were days when I couldn't finish my work because the pain would be unbearable. Since making the switch to the Freestyle2, I haven't had any issues with pain in my hands and wrists. I recommend taking regular breaks and looking into stretches for added comfort. My only other complaint about this keyboard is that there is no number keypad. I don't really need one for my workflow, the number line works well enough, but the split design makes using numbers a slower experience. It isn't unmanageable, but people who work with numbers should look into getting a separate keypad. Kinesis offers a Numeric Keypad for those interested.

If you are looking to make your setup a bit more ergonomic, consider the Kinesis Freestyle2 Keyboard. This is the perfect option if you don't care about a backlight, customizations, or key switches.

Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2023
Color: 9 Inch Separation Verified Purchase
Love the large "esc" and "delete" keys! Love the left side keys for web back, web forward, copy, paste keys.

The keyboard does all it advertises, thus the 5 stars. That said, there are a couple of things I would like to see:
- I knew that add-ons to "tent up" the keyboard can create complexities. But a couple of fold-out tabs underneath for a couple a basic tenting heights as a standard feature just seems right for an ergo keyboard...
- There a 7 more keys on that top row that could double as function keys. Would love function options for play, pause and stop for videos and music.

That said, very glad I replaced my old ergo keyboard that broke with this one. It is a keeper.

3.0 out of 5 stars So many good things, offset by so many bad things.
Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2019
Color: 20 Inch Separation Verified Purchase
UPDATE [01/18/2020]: So I have finally given up on this keyboard. After four full months of using it exclusively, the locations of the non-typing keys are just as frustrating as the day I started using it. I was still screwing up the Backspace/Delete thing at least once a day, the Home/End/PageUp/PageDown set are still keys I have to actually think about before I hit any of them (and I use these keys multiple times a day), and the Insert-key-as Function-key has required me to relearn my combo-key patterns (I've switched to using CTRL-C/V, which is not my preference.)

Also, I am endlessly adjusting this keyboard, because it is very easy to slide it out of place, so it is no longer in an ideal typing position anymore. Especially since I'm still having to feel my way around trying to figure out which key I'm about to press. (Again, this doesn't apply to the letters or numbers, just the other "Control" keys on the keyboard.

So, again, I love the idea. It was certainly more comfortable typing with my hands separated. But I spend too much time at my computer to put up with the continued annoyance of those control keys.

[ORIGINAL REVIEW]:
I'm a writer and a programmer. I spend most of my day at my computer. I type a LOT. I've been using some form of ergonomic keyboard since 1995. Lately, I've been worried that even the standard wave keyboard isn't enough, and so I gave this keyboard a try. I bought not just the keyboard, but the lift kit and the extra keypad, as well. (I do too much math on my computer to try to work out the number pad built into the keyboard keys.)

Let me say right off: For straight-on typing of articles, stories, blogs, any kind of normal text, this keyboard is excellent. The ability to separate the two halves to a fully comfortable position for your own body is great. The problems come when you try to do something that is NOT typing of normal text. Like keyboard combinations or shortcuts of any kind. Here are the things I have against this keyboard:

It FEELS cheap. It's not: it seems to be well-constructed, but it doesn't feel like it. It feels flimsy, and the little lifters that come with the ($35!!!) accessory kit also seem pretty chintzy. The only metal I can find on this keyboard seems to be in the screws holding it together, and the plastic feels thin.

$11-$20 for 11" of cord: The one and only difference between the two Freestyle2 models is that one has a 9" cord, and one has a 20" cord. They are charging you at least $1 a foot for a piece of cable. This is something they should be downright ashamed of.

And while we're on the subject of the cord: It is NOT REPLACEABLE. They didn't use something like a USB cable, or an ethernet cable, or some other standard, or even proprietary, plug-in wire. No, the cable - the thing most likely to get damaged on this device - is hard-wired into the keyboard. If you damage the cable, you get to buy a new keyboard.

Everything is jammed together: In an effort to save costs (Don't tell me it's for ergonomics, because my experience shows it isn't), they have mushed all of the keys as close together as they can get away with. There is NO SPACE between the end of the "main" keyboard, and the home/end/pgup/pgdn set, and the arrow keys are jammed into the corner space left over, with only the tiniest of breaks between those keys and the main keyboard. This means you can no longer use edges to feel your way to the key you want: you have to nail it exactly through muscle memory alone.

"Convenience" keys are highly INconvenient: The two columns of keys there on the left? They seem like a great idea... unless you are used to indexing your left hand against the side of the keyboard for things like ALT+TAB, or any CTRL+KEY combinations...

The Insert key is a FUNCTION key (you have to activate the function keys by pressing another key before you can use them). And what super-important, cannot-do-without key is in that spot when the function keys are not active? The Pause/Break key! When was the last time you used the Pause/Break key? (NOT TALKING TO YOU PROGRAMMERS!!!)

The DELETE key, and the BACKSPACE key: They are identical size, and one right above the other. I cannot count the number of times I have pressed one when I meant to press the other one. In fact, it is so annoyingly close in position, that I have repeated this mistake three times IN A ROW. In order to assure I hit the correct one, I actually have to index my hand against the right side of the keyboard.

No breaks in the F-keys: Not a huge problem, but my preference with function keys is the "groups of 4" method. I realize it would be hard to do on this keyboard, but here, you have a straight row of either 7 or 8 keys with no breaks at all. You're not going to be able to find the one you want with any speed unless it's one you hit dozens of times a day.

The ad claims "no learning curve". This is an outright lie. I'm a touch typist, and I consider myself pretty fast (70+ wpm). I make far more errors with this keyboard, even after a full month of constant use, than I did with my old one. Also, there is a period of adjustment that lasted for several days for me, where you feel very odd typing with your hands so far apart. That goes away, but it is certainly something that you have to get used to.

In short, I like the idea of this keyboard, but Kinesis' execution sucks. And the price they're charging for what really is nothing more than a keyboard broken into two pieces with a wire in the middle is... ludicrous. I'm still using this keyboard, but if it were to break, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't buy another one.

Been using this for two years now with the VIP3 Tenting Accessory kit and just love it. I can change the angle of the keyboard (in/out or up/down) to how my wrists / arms want it that day. However, it does tend to slide about. Not going to ding the product for me resting my wrists or having plastic desk covers on my desk. I already have both saved in the wish list for when I spill something on it (been there/done that) or drop something on it (ditto). Barring that or a fur baby knocking them off my desk, the both should last a while.

The option to keep the keyboard together is good to get used to the layout. I increased the distance gradually and in a week I am typing with very few errors, looking at the keyboard. My shoulder is much better - very happy with it. Really love the copy & paste & undo button. I even dowloaded a software and reassigned one key to have ENTER on the left hand. Brilliant. The only thing is that the keyboard is flat, without the option to raise it (as expected in all keyboards). I use two post it to do it, but it is annoying

Really, really good. I was having pain in my pectoral minor due to a lot of typing. Within 2 days of getting this keyboard, the pain was gone.
The review that complains about typing odd letters is written by someone who has not realised that one of the function keys is on. The extra function keys are really useful and make work more efficient, if you take the trouble to give them a careful once over before you start using them.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on January 10, 2020
Color: 9 Inch Separation Verified Purchase
Really comfortable keyboard to use. I would recommend buying with the tent accessories. One downside is that it is a little ugly, but it's a small price to pay for the extra comfort.

4.0 out of 5 stars Great for RSI but needs the accessories

Color: 9 Inch Separation Verified Purchase
Really happy with this keyboard, it's definitely been helping my RSI but it's pretty useless unless you buy the legs etc. to go with it so you can prop it up.
