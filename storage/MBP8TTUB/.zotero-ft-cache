Introduction
Social networking sites have seen an amazing growth rate over the last couple of years. As long as the interface is easy and visually appealing, these are a sure shot win for the founders. Not only is this applicable for websites but also the incredibly large number of mobile applications that have been developed recently. These make social networking more easily accessible and are constantly being improved to make them better for the user.
One such networking service that has a large number of users from all over the world is Instagram. You are probably already on it or at least know someone else who has an Instagram profile. Ever since it was launched, the service is being used by increasing number of people each day. Everyone from the girl next door to celebrities has been using their service to make their social media presence more prominent.
Here, you will learn everything there is to know about Instagram. Everything starting from the basics of creating a profile on the service to utilizing it is covered here. Once you are done going through all the information we have put together for you, you can efficiently use this service as simply as you do a pen.

Chapter 1: How Did Instagram Begin?
Mike Krieger and Kevin Systrom are the main names behind the invention of Instagram. It was evolved from an application for iPhones known as Burbn. The Burbn app was a little too complicated in its initial stages but the duo worked on it. They finally made it into a simpler concept and called it Instagram. At first, Burbn could be used to check in, make future plans, and earn points and such. They then decided to remove all the clutter and focus on being good at one specific thing. Their point of focus turned out to be sharing mobile photography. Considering it was similar to an instant telegram, they renamed it as Instagram.
Kevin Systrom actually learned how to code all by himself without signing up for any professional courses. He then went ahead and built the Burbn prototype in HTML5 and gave it to his friends to try out. Soon after he attended a party prospective investors were attending. Since they agreed to invest in his idea, he quit his job and went all in. Kevin then started working with Mike Krieger to build Burbn. They realized that all the different functions that they tried to cram in were making things worse. Focusing on sharing photos, they built a prototype. However, this did not work out well either. They made Burbn an iPhone app but it still wasn’t what they were looking for. De-cluttering everything, they decided to focus solely on the photos. Renaming this simple yet ingenious photo-sharing version as Instagram, they launched it. And as we all know, became an overnight success.
Although the app was initially just for iPhone users, they released a version for Android phones in 2012. This got them many more users in a couple of hours of launch itself. Soon after, Facebook started talks to acquire Instagram. Within a couple of months and with all the legal technicalities out of the way, the deal

was sealed. The amount in question for this deal was estimated at about a billion dollars. Later in 2013, Instagram also launched a version for Windows Phone. Instagram also added the "Direct" feature in December of 2013. This was aimed at competing with other social messaging apps to allow users private messaging as well.
Over time Instagram keeps updating and making changes to the app to make it better than it already is.

Chapter 2: Getting Started With Instagram
Although Instagram can be accessed from online, it is a mobile platform. To get started, you need to download the application on your device. You can only do so on apple or android devices.
Once you download the application, you can register your own personal account. Once you register, you can access this account by entering your username and password on any device that has the application.
After you have registered, you can see to other details. For instance, you can set a photo of your choice as your profile picture and change this at any time. You can then enter all the other information required on your profile.
You will also see that there is an option of entering a bio on your profile. The limit is set to 150 characters on this and you can fill it in accordingly or even leave it blank. You can also enter a website link into your bio. Other users can click on this and go to the page by clicking on it directly. The account will be on public display for all Instagram users by default. However, you can go ahead and change it to private as well. This will require you to approve the “Follow” request that any user sends you if they wish to view your profile. This privacy choice depends entirely on you.

Notifications
To set how the notifications appear on your device, go to the notification center in your setting and configure. This will allow you to control if the notifications appear externally or only when you are using the app. To can select Push Notifications in the settings tab of the app. You get notifications under the News tab while using Instagram. They appear as a heart or speech bubble depending on likes or comments. The feed under News will show you the specifications of any notification.
The notification feature will help you to see when anyone likes your posts or comments on them. You can also be notified if they mention your username on any other post in a comment. If someone tags you in a photo, you will be notified as well. You will also be alerted if anybody starts following your profile. As we mentioned before, this follow request will first have to be approved by you if the profile is set as private. Notifications will also let you know if any of your posts make it to the popular page.

Social connectivity
Instagram can be used all by itself and is definitely more than enough. However, the whole point of social networking is to connect as far and wide as possible. You also have the option of connecting your Instagram account to other social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, Flickr, Mixi, Weibo, Tumblr and VK. You can connect this by linking the profiles under settings.
Go to your Profile and edit the Sharing Settings under that tab. You can then choose to which network you want to link your account.
This will allow you to share any Instagram post from your profile to the linked social network as well. You have the option to share or not but the link is enabled if you should choose to do so. If you do share it on any other platform, any other people you are connected to you there can view the post. However, the privacy settings will still be valid on your actual Instagram profile.

Adding Photos and Videos
You can choose to share photos or videos on your Instagram account. This is the main point of setting up an account on this service. What you upload will make a huge difference in a lot of things. We will be getting into details regarding that later on.
First let’s take a look at exactly how you can upload.
The first choice is to take a picture through the camera button at the center of the panel. This connects to the camera of your device. You can now take a picture or video through this.
The app also allows you to shoot or upload videos. These have to have a minimum length of 3 seconds and can extend up to 15 seconds. When you shoot a video, you can click on the record button to start. If you want a continuous segment, just keep your finger on the button the entire time you are shooting. If you want multiple different clips, just remove your finger where you want to stop.
The second option is to upload something that is already saved on your camera roll. Although you previously had to crop your images to the square that Instagram required, things have changed. You can now use pictures with any ratio without having to cut or add to them. Once you choose what you want to upload, you can go ahead and edit if you choose. Then all that left to do is to upload.

Editing
Once you select your photo you can choose to use it in its original form or better yet enhance with some editing. Instagram has some amazing filters that can change the look of your image in different ways.
You can choose to use the readymade filters that are built on the app or do it yourself. Increase or decrease features like the brightness or contrast and make the picture look much more professional. Tilt shift is another great editing option that will allow you to give a type of altered depth of field. You can choose between the horizontal bar or circle when you sue this and rotate your picture for the best effect as well.
The lux effect is like an auto-enhancing option. It enriches the image when you click on the sun icon. You can increase or decrease the depth of this as well.
You can also edit the pictures on other photo apps and upload onto your Instagram profile. The choices are nearly unlimited when it comes to this.

Filters on Instagram
The service has ready to use filters for any pictures the user wants to upload. You can choose to use the original photo that you click through the application. You can also upload pictures that you have stored on your device from before. As opposed to using the photos in their original form, these in-built filters can help you enhance or modify the look of it. The following descriptions of the Instagram filters will help you get a better understanding of how each filter will modify your original image.
Normal: This is the primary choice of keeping the photo as it is. Lo-fi: This filter helps to enhance the warmth of the temperature and increases the level of saturation. This will in turn make the shadows more prominent and enrich the colors. Earlybird: This popular filter gives the picture the look of older days. The tint is sepia and the warmth of temperature level increases. Amaro: This puts the focus on the center of the image and also increases light in it. Rise: The light on the subject is softened and a glow effect is placed. Inkwell: The image is converted to a black and white visual with no other modifications. Sutro: The edges of the picture are given a burnt affect while highlights are increased. Any purple or brown points on the image are focused upon with stronger shadows. Mayfair: This adds a subtle pinkish tone and the center appears brighter due to the vignette effect at the edges. A border is added in a black slender line. Sierra: This gives the image a softer look and makes it appear faded. Valencia: This gives the image an antique effect as the warmth of the colors is increased along with exposure levels.

Nashville: This is meant to give a picture a certain nostalgic feel by giving it a subtle pink tint. The contrast is decreased while exposure and temperature levels are increased. Toaster: This makes the picture look aged by adding a prominent vignette and burn to the center. Perpetua: This is a good filter for portraits as it adds a pastel effect to the image. X-Pro: This adds a tint of gold and increases the vibrancy of colors. The contrast is increased and the edges gain some vignette effect. Cream: This adds a hint of both warmth and chill with a creamy effect. Walden: This is yet another popular filter that adds a yellowish tint to the image and increases the level of exposure. Aden: This increases the tint of blues and greens in the picture. Slumber: It decreases the saturation level and emphasizes the black or blue hues in the picture. A haze is added to give it a dreamy retro effect. Ludwig: This decreases the saturation slightly and increases the light.
These are some of the basic Instagram filters that are used. There are a few more and you should also notice that they often add new filters with the updates on the app.

Sharing
The screen where all the sharing options are displayed appears once you have finished editing the image. You can add a caption to go with the picture or video. Adding hash tags will allow the picture to be visible when people search for those particular categories. You can also mention people in the caption with the @ sign and then their username.
You can also tag people on the image. Another option is to mention the location of where the image was taken. You can then choose to share the picture on other sites like Facebook or twitter when you upload on to Instagram. You can do this before or even after uploading the image on your profile.

Instagram Direct
The Instagram direct feature is used for sharing pictures or videos privately. You can choose exactly who gets to view these. In 2015 this feature saw the addition of direct messaging as well.
The above-mentioned steps are the most basic way to get started on using this great social service that the world loves. As you read on further, we will explain everything in detail and how you can get better at everything you do on Instagram.

Chapter 3: How To Make A Great Instagram
Account?
In order to get popular on Instagram, you should have a great account with amazing pictures and with a few other tricks up your sleeve and you’re set. There are millions of users who have an account on Instagram and you need to put in some effort in order to be amongst the best of them. If you put up the right posts at the right time, you’re quite likely to get popular in a short time. As you read on, we will guide you to create an Instagram profile that will be the envy of others.
Your first step in creating an account is choosing the perfect username. The name should be catchy and should catch the eye of other users. Try not to make it too long or have too many symbols in it.
The second step is choosing the perfect profile picture. Putting up your own photo is the best option so that people will link your profile to your face. Find a fun and good quality picture of yourself to use for this purpose or click a new one.
You should now give careful thought to choosing a theme for your Instagram profile. It has been noticed that pages with a particular theme get more number of followers and likes on their posts. This is because the followers will know what the page is exactly about and follow based on their interest. You can also choose to post whatever you want outside of any specific theme that limits you. However, a themed page has more chances of getting popular. For instance, if you are someone who loves food, make the theme food related. If you are interested in fashion, focus on that. This allows users to have an idea of what they’ll be seeing in their

feed by following your account. In fact, you theme can have other variations other than subject as well. It could be a color code where all your pictures are black and white or have a pink hue. It could also be random pictures of different places but with your dog in all of them. Get creative with your theme and make it uniquely yours.
After you have decided a theme, start clicking some great pictures. Learn how to use your camera in the best way possible to get the best shot. You can go ahead and click a hundred different photos of the same subject to get the best angle. This is worth it even if you just end up using that one image that you think is perfect. Get a firm grasp on how the editing options in Instagram work as well. This will help you enhance the images and give them the best visual possible.
Build a portfolio before your start working on getting more followers. There are a lot of tricks that you can use to generate traffic to your profile but very few people will follow you if your profile is empty. So start by uploading a few great pictures that will make your account look good and make users anticipate better posts in future. Don’t upload a post that is meaningless and has bad quality. Quantity is not what you are aiming for, but quality definitely is. Work on getting these pictures up and then get those followers.
Find out what the best photo editing applications are. Download the ones that suit your purpose and theme. Utilize all the amazing options available to you. Different applications offer different tools to make your photos better or more creative. Some will let you adjust the brightness, saturation, etc. Others will allow you to insert text in different typography on the photo. Use these for posting some great pictures on your Instagram account.
Give some thought to the captions. You can choose to have short or long captions. However, these should be to the point and not some boring narrative that your followers lose interest in half way through reading.

Your captions could be inspiring, funny, sarcastic, or just about anything. They should, however, relate to the photo and not be completely out of context. You can tell the story of your picture using the caption. This helps your followers relate more to your content.
Be personal in your posts. This profile is entirely yours and should be distinctive from others. Other users will choose to follow you only if they feel your feed is distinct from other run of the mill accounts that they have no interest in. your followers should be able to feel a connection with you. It doesn’t mean that you have to have some kind of emotional outburst in every post. Getting personal means that the user feels that they are seeing bits and pieces of you in your photos and not just a random cup of coffee. This coffee picture should narrate a story of whom you are having it with or where you like it best. That personal touch can make a lot of difference.
Link your Instagram profile to any and every other social media accounts that you have. This could be your Facebook account or any other blog that you have as well. This will help you generate a number of followers from here to your Instagram as well. If you have a huge following on twitter or any such network, just update a post and let them know that you are now on Instagram as well. Most of them will definitely follow through if not all.
Make your Instagram slight unique as compared to any other social media account you have. Give your friends and other users a reason to follow your Instagram account specifically. Why would they do this if all your content were the same on every online profile that you have. If you have a popular Tumblr account, your followers would follow you on Instagram as well if they felt there was something more to see here and not just the same thing in a different format.
Follow other users and like their posts as well. Other Instagram users usually want the same thing as you even if they aren’t going about it the smart way as you are. However, liking the posts that others put up will

add a lot of brownie points for you. Find other accounts where the posts are similar to yours. See who follows these accounts and follow them. Once you appear on their news feed, they will probably check out your account and follow you back too. You should also like the posts of the people you follow or it looks as if it’s a ghost account. You can also choose not to follow these people and just like or comment on their pictures. This will also get their attention if you don’t want to follow as many people as you want followers. Your comments will not only be noticed by the owner of the profile but also other followers of the same person.
Interact with your followers and other users. Comment on the pictures that other users put up. Most people appreciate comments more than likes on their pictures. You can be amongst the select few who make the effort. This will definitely make the user interested in your account and maybe make them follow you as well. You should also make it a point to reply to all the comments that people leave on your posts. This will encourage them to continue commenting and liking your other pictures. It also builds a loyalty following for you because of the interactive effort you made. This will help build your own Instagram community.
Use hash tags to direct people to your photos even if they aren’t following you. The main way in which Instagram users discover each other are by searching for tags on categories that interest them. You should also pay attention to which hash tags are trending during that period and use them on your posts. This will allow more likes to be generated on your post while that particular tag is trending.
Contests are yet another great way in which you can engage with other Instagram users. You can also hold your own contest at some point on your page when you have a lot of followers and a particular theme to your page. This will in turn direct more traffic to your Instagram profile and allow you to gain more followers.

Do not post too many pictures too often. Your followers don’t want just your posts to flood their feed. You just also pay attention to quality over quantity. This will see a much more positive reaction from the user base. Post one good picture a day instead of ten bad pictures that have no point.
Make an effort to find out what kind of posts people like more often. While you should stick to your unique theme, you need to give this some thought if you want a huge number of followers in a short time. Posting such content which gets popular fast will only work to your benefit. For instance, most users have noticed that pictures that are taken at the beach or have sunsets are very popular and get a large number of likes as compared to others. By uploading such content, you will surely see more followers on your account faster than if you posted other pictures all the time. You should keep posting what interests you but also make a conscious effort to put up pictures that interest the audience you want to keep engaged in your profile.
Yet another thing that you should keep in mind is that your profile should be public. The privacy setting should not be switched on to the private account tab. This will definitely not work in your favor if you want more number of followers on your account. It will actually make it harder to attract new follower when they can’t even see what your profile contains that should make them follow you.
Give a moment to writing a good bio as well. You can make it short yet effective in gaining the interest of people. Make the content meaningful or catchy. It can be a brisk description of who you are or what your interests are.

Chapter 4: How to Get More Likes For Your
Instagram Posts?
The most obvious part of using Instagram and posting on it is that you want to share. And the positive feedback that you look for about your posts is gained through likes. Everyone on Instagram wants as many likes as they can possibly get for their posts. This applies to someone running a personal account, bloggers or even businesses. The more the followers and likes on your account, the better it is. Nobody likes it if their post hardly gets 5 likes after having uploaded it 10 hours or so ago. It would definitely be a little if not very disappointing. So let’s take a look at exactly how you can actively make an effort to get more likes on all your Instagram posts.
The most obvious step is to always link your Instagram with your Facebook account. This will help all the people on your Facebook list to see that you have an account on Instagram that they can follow as well. You can either share a picture from Instagram to Facebook or even actively ask your Facebook friends to follow you on Instagram. These are usually your first followers when you make an account. Get as many followers as you can by linking to all your social media accounts. This automatically gives you more number of likes when you post something. One of the first things you need to understand is also that if you post are of good quality, people will obviously like it more. So make a conscious effort to post some good pictures that will catch the attention of other users. Your followers will definitely click the little heart and other users might just start following you out of interest.

Your posts should be personal and attractive to your followers. It should be something that would interest them and capture their attention. You posts should also have a unique quality that makes users want to follow you in order to look forward to future posts. Using hash tags is the easiest way to make your post more visible and discoverable by other Instagram users. These tags should be relevant to the content of your post. People tend to search for tags based on their subject of interest. If they like your post, they will like it and also start following you. The next part of using hash tags is to use popular ones. There are certain tags that are more popular at certain times. Posts with these tags generate a lot of traffic and thus get more likes. Some examples of such tags are this that has the words iphonesia, nofilter, instadaily, webstagram, photooftheday, etc. Using these tags on your posts will make it more likely to get attention from other users. The filters that you use on your image also have a certain effect on users. Studies have shown that posts with certain filters get more likes than posts with some other filters. In fact, pictures with no filter or the normal image get the most amounts of attention and likes. Making the photo as natural yet high quality will make it more popular. In case of those with the use of filters, Valencia, Earlybird, Hefe are amongst the most popular ones. Using these will make it more likely for you post to get a like than any other filters. Commenting on the posts of other users will make it much more likely that they like, comment and follow your account as well. It just makes you much more interactive than all the other users and generates the interest of that user in your account as well. Get likes by spamming other accounts. Go to the explore tab and search for certain hash tags like the following: #likeforlike, #l4l, #spamforspam, #spamback, #likebackalways. Once you search for

these, go to the profile of any user who has this hash tag on their post. Like a few or many of their pictures at once. This will make you appear on their notifications. You can also leave a comment on any one of their pictures and ask them to spam back or like back your pictures. This is one of the simplest ways to get likes on your pictures. Others who want the same are quite willing to return the favor. One of the easiest ways to generate traffic to your account is by liking hundreds of pictures in one day. At least some of them will follow you and like your pictures. Timing is yet another crucial factor in determining how many likes you can generate on your post. There are certain times of the day or days of the week when more people are active. In general, Mondays and Wednesdays have shown to generate a lot of likes on posts. The other thing to notice is when your specific followers are more active. Analyze this using certain other applications and determine when you should post. If you post at a time that they don’t even see your post, you are hardly about to get any likes. You should also not spam the feed of your followers by posting too much at the same time. This will actually annoy them and might even make them unfollow. Less drastically, they will just choose to scroll down without even looking at the post properly. Instead, if you have a lot of good photos of a particular event or subject, just make a collage. A collage is the easiest yet clutter free way of sharing these images with your followers. There are so many apps that allow you to do this in an easy yet attractive way. This will ensure that you get likes without being a spammer.

Tips for getting more likes on your posts
Put up selfies or pictures with more faces. Studies show that a picture with your face on it is more likely to get higher number of likes than those without.
Don’t post too much too often. Appearing on someone’s feed too much can actually make them unfollow you. Try not to post more than a maximum of one or two times a day. Posting too much will decrease the number of likes you get.
The hash tag which says #nofilter shows higher chances of increasing likes on a picture. Even when people are actually lying about it.
Use photo-editing apps to get a wider range of effects for your pictures. You don’t have to limit yourself to the filters on Instagram. A lot of great photo editing apps can make your pictures look like they were shot professionally. This definitely increases the number of likes on your pictures.
Don’t add too many hash tags on your posts. This makes it look as though you are posting for the sole purpose of getting likes. Seven is a good number for increasing the number of views via hash tags. You can find out about the popular hash tags that would increase your likes on sites like tagsforlikes.com.
Get vibrant shots in the right light. Sunsets or a sunrise shot often see more number of likes due to the play in colors.
Taking a photo at the right angle can make a lot of difference. For instance when a person is standing in front of you, take a shot at an upward angle from below. This makes them look better in proportions and taller.
Hues of blue on your photos are shown to be more attractive. Those with predominant red hues show fewer likes in comparison.

Develop your profile according to who you are and what you like. Forget about others and what pictures get more likes or any such things. Take time to figure out what subjects you like to take pictures of. Experiment with different types of editing to see what suits you. Your profile should be unique and different from others.
Taking time to shoot the same subject a number of times will help you get that perfect shot. No one gets it perfect at one go. Look for different angles or a unique type of theme for your pictures.
Take time to look at others feed. Give some thought to the feed of people that capture your attention. See what it is in their pictures that attract you and how you can try the same techniques for yours. Following these kinds of people will help you develop your feed quicker as well.
Use the Iconosquare app to analyze your activity. It will help you see when you get the most number of likes and what time most of your followers are active.
If you already have a great shot without applying filters then improve it with the brightness, saturation, and tools etc. These will enhance the image without changing it drastically.
You don’t necessarily have to use the front facing camera for selfies. Using the rear camera will give you a picture with much better resolution without the dreary grainy effect.
Don’t post too many pictures of the same thing and flood your follower’s feed. Just put them all together in a collage and share at once.
Participate in # projects held by the official Instagram page or other popular pages to get your posts noticed. If your post makes it to these or the popular page, your followers are much more likely to increase overnight.
Use hash tags to increase the engagement on your posts. The more the hash tags, the more number of people are likely to view it. Instagram allows you to add up to 30 hash tags to each post and you can use them all

to your benefit. Don’t edit your pictures too much. It decreases the likelihood of getting
more likes. The more normal your picture looks, the more people like it. Brighter pictures get more likes than those that are darker. The same
image with higher brightness got more number of likes than when it was in a darker setting.
Cooler colors engage more people than a warmer palate with red, orange or pink hues.
Get a theme. Decide on a theme for your profile. Most of the popular profiles on Instagram show a particular theme with respect to each. Users will get an idea of what they can expect when they follow you and are more likely to do so if they like what they see. Consistency is the key to maintaining a theme on your account. The theme could be location based, food based or even color based. The point is, when the user sees the overall account, they should notice the theme.
Captions are another focus point. The picture could be great and the caption will make it even better. Your caption allows your users to get an insight into the story of the picture. Your followers should look forward to the next story you will tell.
Consistency as well as rhythm in updating is also important. You should not post ten pictures in one day and disappear for the next week. Or even upload every day for a month and disappear for the next sixth. This might make users stop following your feed or liking it.
Get involved with your followers. Check out their accounts and maybe like some posts even if you don’t follow them back. Reply to the comments they leave on your posts. Show that you appreciate their likes and build a positive relationship. This will gain you a loyal following on your account.

Chapter 5: Instagram for Business
Instagram evolved from solely being a platform for social networking to a possible source of income. Using the concept of sharing on this popular forum is using it in so many different ways. A lot of businesses flocked here to utilize their services and reach out to the user base of millions. Big brand names to small closet shops, you can find the whole lot amongst the thousands of user profiles that use Instagram for business. As you read on, we will tell you can do the same and get positive results like they have.
Instagram itself is not a service that sells any product or services. The platform can however be used for the benefit of such businesses. Brands have been using Instagram to market their product and make their presence valid on this popular service. Smaller scale retail shops can be found on Instagram where the followers are given instructions on how they can purchase items provided by them. The possibilities for using Instagram for business are vast.
To get started, first create an Instagram account for you particular business. It works the same way as any normal user profile but this is business-centric as opposed to a personal account. Due to the huge boom in users making use of Instagram for business, the service started a blog called Instagram for Business. This helps the users in more ways than one to see how they can make use of Instagram for work.
Once your page is up, start posting. Make sure your posts are done with the customer in mind. Think of what would interest them and at the same time promote your business or products. Keep a balance between some fun posts purely for the pleasure of the follower and those that are focused

on benefiting your business.
Make your posts such that they are targeted at the customers that you want. Your posts should have that certain “thing” that will target these particular users. If your business is related to some healthy food product, use this as your theme. Post about health in any way possible and inspire these users with similar interests to follow you. Your account can’t solely be about being like a catalogue for your product. Develop a certain message and image for your business or brand. Align this according to the customer base you are targeting but don’t look excessively commercial and business focused.
Make your posts customer-centric. Users will follow you when they fell that your posts will benefit them in some way or interest them. If you upload random photos that are irrelevant to the customers, they won’t get engaged with your Instagram. Put up products in a way that the customer feels interested enough to give time to actually look at your post and then maybe go ahead and buy it.
Your account should be a visual experience for any user who views it. They will then get an idea of what to expect when they follow your account. It should be aesthetically pleasing and interesting to them. Find creative ways to showcase your services or products.
As you start posting, start working on getting as many followers and likes on your account. This is the main point of using Instagram for your business; you want to increase the user interface. There are a lot of different ways to do this and we will explain this in detail further on in the chapter. The basics are to connect to other social networks, use popular

hash tags and keep interacting with followers.
Use the Video feature on Instagram for uploading short advertisements for your business or anything that will engage your followers. These are short and effective in generating interest. Share these videos via links on other social media as well to generate more views.
Make a schedule for posting. You cannot post infrequently or too often either. Maintain a balance and keep your Instagram active while at the same time not overactive. Your followers obviously want to see your posts but not ten times a day. This is where a schedule helps you. Keep posts ready to upload and do them at appropriate times. Keep note of when your users are more active and post during such times. Make sure the posts are of interest to them as well.
Use other applications that will help your Instagram feed become much better. There is a huge range of different applications that allow you to enhance the photos, print them, analyze your profile, etc. Spend some time in seeing which apps will help you get the most out of your Instagram experience. Go through the accounts of other popular users and see what they are using as well. Use the analyzing tools provided by some applications to see which posts garner the maximum interest and gain more followers for your account. These posts can be used further for more advertising as well since they become popular images that users will identify with your brand.
Make your posts as attractive as possible. The images should look high quality and be vibrant. Make use of the filters on Instagram. You can also utilize the hundreds of other photo editing apps available for this. Make the photo look as aesthetically appealing to the follower as possible.

Use the different hash tags, contests, etc. that are trending to market your brand on a frequent basis. This will keep you on the grid with all the latest things that grab interests of users over time.
Interacting with other Instagram users and your followers is very important. You should not just expect them to like and comment without responding as well. Reply to comments and like their pictures as well. As you build a relationship with them, they will be loyal to show their appreciation as well. You can also work with other established users like bloggers to promote your page and return the favor.
You should also show followers how the inside of your business works. You may have noticed how many brands have been putting up pictures of events where they celebrate with their employees. This shows a positive image of the brand or business and creates a good name for it. So go ahead and post a picture of some employee at work on their craft and happy while they do it. Your customers will be quite happy to buy that as well we think. Put up the picture of a work lunch or dinner. Maybe upload a video of some product being made in a creative process.
Benefits of Instagram for Business
Instagram is definitely one of the most versatile social media applications when it comes to exactly how you can use it. Aside from using it to share photos and videos like a personal blog, it has proved to be an immensely useful tool for businesses. It allows any business of any size to reach out to the millions of users on the app. Take a look at a few ways in which having an Instagram page for your business can benefit you:
It is an extremely convenient way to show your products to a huge

potential customer base. People need to be able to see what’s on offer in order to know if they want to buy it. You can share good quality images of your products or services on your account.
Yet another way to personally connect with the customer base is to show them how your business works or how the products are made. Most people these days want more details about how their products are manufactured or produced. Sharing some posts related to this makes them have more faith in your company.
It is like a free advertising tool for your products and services. You can come up with creative concepts on how to showcase what you have on offer to the users on Instagram. Show them how the products can be of use to them and why they should come to you and not anyone else. Instead of paying for other forms of advertising, use your resources to make some amazing concept posts. These will automatically reach out to more people if they’re actually quality content and this will then generate more customers for your business.
The fact that the customers will get something extra by following you on Instagram can be a great incentive. Give them first peeks into new products and launches.
You can get more connected by showing them where and how your business works. Share pictures of your employees and what they do at the office each day. Show people how exciting or happy your work environment is and creates a positive image that definitely will work in your favor.
Another benefit is that you can connect with other influential users on Instagram and get them to promote your products as well. A few tips and tricks like these help you reach the maximum number of people that you possibly can on Instagram. Since these influencers already have a loyal following, their followers will also be interested in you. Celebrities on Instagram can also help you out with the right incentives. So go ahead and

make use of these.

Instagram analytics
The analytics involve tracking the performance of the account. This means that you can see how well or poorly your posts are doing once you upload them. Getting a proper analysis of your performance ultimately helps you do better in future. This is especially essential for any business accounts. You need to have a clear idea of what you customers actually take notice of and what kind of posts they get engaged in. this helps you make more posts along those lines and thus generate more traffic. The data that analytic tools provide will help you see if you are meeting the initial goals that you had set out to meet.
If you are not, you can then make changes accordingly to move in that direction. Depending on your follower base, you can generate a weekly or even daily report. The analytics should help you see how your follower growth graph is. It will also help you take note of who your top followers are and how much people engage in your posts. One of the best parts is that it helps to identify which timings and days are the best for you to post. These are peak timings when most of your followers tend to be using the application and have more chances of actually viewing your profile or posts.

Chapter 6: How to Make Profitable Posts?
Since you are a business on Instagram, your main objective is to get more profits in the big picture. Let’s take a look at how your Instagram posts can be used for this purpose.
Firstly, upload pictures of your products in a creative manner but the product should be the highlight and in a high-resolution photo. In case of a business account, you should give more time and effort to getting the perfect picture that will appeal to the consumers.
Use easy links to allow your followers a fast and easy way to purchase any product that catches their fancy. If you upload the picture of a specific product, add a link in the caption to direct the user to the main website where they can purchase it. This makes it convenient for them and much more likely for you to make a sale.
Don’t be crude and overly objective in your posts. Be subtle in your message to followers when you coax them to buy your products. The post should be attractive and have its own story. It should not just be a catalogue image of a product with the price on it. Make the picture compelling and the product look good in a way that the user wants to go ahead and buy it from the link you have added somewhere in there.
Use the Instagram direct feature for interacting with prospective customers. This allows the conversation to be private and you can send pictures, video or just messages via this. It doesn’t just have to be about sales but just so that you can reach out to followers who are particularly active on your page. This makes them feel appreciated and gains you a loyal customer too.
Make sure you offer discounts, contests or other offers in some posts.

This will make more people follow your Instagram account so that they can keep track of these at any point that you post. This is especially effective if the offers are valid only for users who follow your account.
Like we mentioned above, contests are a great way to market your brand and get many more followers. Hosting a contest or giveaway can be fun and engaging for your followers. This will bring more traffic to your account and work in your favor for a small price. Let’s take a look at an example of how a giveaway is held. The post should clearly state that a giveaway is being conducted and state the terms and conditions of it. You can choose to state what the gift will be or make it a surprise as well. The instructions in the caption should explain how people could participate. For example, they should follow your page, tag your account in a post of theirs and tag their friends as well. You can then choose a lucky winner from this or add more conditions to your giveaway. It’s quite simple and allows more people to view the presence of your Instagram account.

How to reach out to more users?
Via Facebook
Linking your Instagram account with your Facebook page will make a huge difference. Facebook has a larger user interface and will generate more likes for the same post. You can also set up advertisements or campaigns on Facebook that make a certain offer exclusive for those who follow the page on Instagram. This will definitely make more of your Facebook fans or friends flock to your Instagram page. You can constantly show that you are an active entity on Instagram and make people eager enough that they wouldn’t want t miss out on the Instagram front.
Via the Official Website
If you already have an established website, promote your Instagram page on it. This site gets most of your traffic from your active customers. Generate this traffic to your Instagram account by promoting it online. Generate banners on your homepage to link your customers to the Instagram account. Entice them with offers and campaigns.
Via Email
Emails are a huge part of most online marketing strategies. Your business probably has an email newsletter that you frequently send out. Add links to your Instagram in these emails. Make your Instagram presence visible via your newsletters. Show the user that how Instagram is a prominent part of your business and that could benefit from following you on the service.
Via Contests
Instagram contests have become one of the best ways to generate traffic onto your account. Nearly every single business on the service has utilized this particular method of marketing as they saw positive results for others who tried

it. Hold an Instagram exclusive contest to engage your followers and other users by tempting them with a small gift. Everyone loves a free gift whether it’s small or big. Sometimes they don’t even care that it’s something that they wouldn’t normally buy. As long as it’s free, people tend to want it. One way to engage people is by telling them that they need to like certain posts, share it on their own accounts and tag the brand on it. This allows more people to view your Instagram presence. Since something like this is quite easy to carry out, most of your followers will go ahead and share. You can then choose a lucky winner according to the terms and conditions met by the contestant. These contests can be weekly, monthly or completely random. However, you will surely see a larger number of followers being generated on these occasions. Another smart way to make this work is giving your own products as a prize. If the users like it, they will be paying for it the next time. So you are actually generating more customers as well.
Via hash tags
Users search for images that they like via hash tags of that particular category. Find out which hash tags are searched for the most on Instagram and use them on your posts. This will make your posts appear on their search results and generate traffic to your page if the post is attractive to the user. Popular hash tags are the most common way to get likes and followers.

Chapter 7: Marketing Tips For Instagram Business
In order to make your presence on the platform prominent enough to generate profits, you need to use the right tips and tricks. This chapter will tell you how you can use some simple yet effective marketing strategies for your business on Instagram.
The first and foremost thing to always keep in mind about Instagram is that it is a photo sharing service. Hence the main thing to focus on is that your photos are high quality with great content. The better they are, the more likely they are to gain popularity with likes and then follow for your account. Use different apps and a good camera for getting such photos for your account. Sponsored ads by the Instagram service are another great option for your business. Marketing yourself requires quite a bit of effort and can only reach out to a limited amount of audience. Sponsored ads that you pay for will make your advertisements visible to just about any target audience whose feed you want it to appear on. Investing in these can be a good marketing strategy as well. Use your bio strategically and creatively. Put up a link to direct traffic to your main business website. Use tools to make this a short link that connects fast to the other page. Also try to make this landing page familiar for your Instagram followers. They should be able to identify with it and feel that the contents of this page are directed specifically at them. The link can also be changed from time to time to direct the users to a specific page where a certain offer or contest is going on. Help out others and they’ll return the favor. Like we mentioned before, promote other users on Instagram. These could be anyone or

any business. As long as they help to promote you and direct other users to your account, it will work to your benefit. Return the favor and you build a solid relationship that you both can benefit from. This is why you should reach out to other users who have a prominent presence on the Instagram portal. This is especially easy if the categories of your businesses are similar or complement each other. Use trending hash tags that are constantly on the Explore page. This will help your posts be more visible. Engage the followers or users that visit your page and build a better connection. After they follow you on Instagram, entice them to give you their email addresses or to follow you on other social media where you have built a presence. This helps on all fronts. Emails are the easiest way to have a personal connection with your customers. You can constantly inform them of anything that is going on at your brand or send them those weekly newsletters to keep them engaged with your business. Keeping in touch is a very important part in building this relationship. Pay for sponsored accounts to shout out for your business. This is one of the cheapest options for getting more followers and likes on Instagram. These accounts are built solely to help others who pay them to get more traffic in their Instagram. They have a base of thousands of followers whom they then direct to your account. It’s a great way to get an instant increase in prospective customer base. Get connected to real time Instagram influencers. These people are a very prominent presence on Instagram and have some of the largest number of followers. If you somehow connect with them and make them use your products, it’s a sure win. These influencers usually use products and post about them in a personal way. This influences their followers to try it out as well and will thus increase your customers or at least followers. If the influencer seems interested in the brand, the

followers tend to follow as well. Their post should have a positive review about your brand or business. By tagging your account in the post and caption, they link their followers to you.

Using Instagram advertising
As we have mentioned above, Instagram has an advertising option that you can avail by paying for it. This will be a step-by-step guide on how you can avail this particular service for you business.
You first need to connect the Instagram account to the Facebook account. The advertisement will be created with Facebook Power Editor. Under the settings tab in Facebook, you will see the Instagram ads option. Click on it and add an account. Here you will have to enter the username and password for you Instagram account. Confirm these details and click.
Next, you have to select the type of ad that you want. Here you can select from three main objectives for your ads. They could be for clicks for your website, video views or installing mobile apps.
Choose an image ad that will have a normal photo with a button that will link the user for clicks. Choose a video ad that will also have a button but will be in video format. Choose a Carousel ad that has a series of images to look through.
Depending on the type of ad you choose, you can accomplish your goal.
Set your target audience once you have selected the type of ad. You can select the locations, age and gender of the people you want your ad to reach. There are more detailed options to limit your audience further but these are the basics that will help you reach the people you want. Using this targeting option properly can make quite a big difference.
Create amazing content for your advertisement so that it captures the eye

and interest of your targeted audience. It should be creative yet clear in its message. A great photo or video is crucial for a great campaign.
Use your advertisements to their maximum benefit. Calls to action are a great way to engage your viewers in connecting with you after seeing the ad. You could tell them to tag people in the comments, tag your account in the posts, use a specific hash tag, etc.
Attract your audience with a great ad and see how it boosts your business in more ways than one. An advertisement can be used to build on the brand image along with generating more sales.

Chapter 8: Things to Avoid on Instagram
All the above-mentioned content is to help you build a strong presence on Instagram. These will help you whether you are building a personal profile or one for business purposes. However, this chapter will help you to avoid mistakes that many people make. The main point of this chapter is to tell you what you shouldn’t do as opposed to all the to-do tips we have put together in previous chapters. Making some of these mistakes can be why your profile never kicks off and sometime even gets shut down by Instagram. Your profile should have a positive image and not generate any controversy that affects you as an individual or makes your business suffer loss either. Some of the things mentioned below are just silly faux passes that you can avoid while some might turn out to be serious offences if you don’t take heed.
Don’t upload pictures of the same subject from ten different angles in a span of 2 minutes. This will make your followers annoyed and might make them unfollow you too.
Don’t upload pictures or videos of low quality or which appear grainy. You should also avoid stealing content from the profiles of other
Instagram users. If you are reposting, make sure to give the attribution due to the actual owner of the post.
Don’t upload pictures of yourself doing any illegal activities. This could be anything from taking or selling drugs to breaking and entering a place. The repercussion for these could be big if the authorities get a report on it.
You should also try to avoid posting any pictures which are not your own. Don’t search for pictures from other online resources and upload as your own.
Don’t comment negatively on someone’s body. Body shaming is

seriously offensive and will get you a lot of criticism once people notice. Do not post pictures of random people without taking permission from
them. While you might feel that they would be proud f having their picture put up, many people are actually reluctant to do so. This might even cause them to report you.
Don’t ignore your followers. Completely ignoring their comments on your pictures will make them see you in a negative light. Try to interact as often as possible if not all the time.
Do not use offensive language when you interact with other users. This will create a bad image for you and even your business if you represent one.
Don’t compromise your privacy and security when it comes to certain matters. For that matter, don’t compromise anyone else’s either. Do not give away personal phone numbers, addresses, social security numbers, credit card details, etc. in public. Be cautious of who you give it to even if it is on direct messaging.
If you are a business, brand, etc., try to remain neutral in case of issues like politics. If you post something that takes a particular side on any given issue, it could offend quite a few of your followers who see differently on that matter. Try to maintain a balance and peaceful front.
Do not do anything that contradicts the terms and conditions of having an Instagram account. Read through their policy carefully and make sure you avoid going against it.
Don’t use services that make you pay for likes and follows. The apps you should be paying for are those which help you improve your content in a way that automatically generates a more popular profile.
Lastly, don’t use Instagram for any activity that is illegal or has the potential to harm anybody.

Chapter 9: Impact of Instagram
1 in every 7 person in the world is on Facebook. Whatsapp has 700 million users, which is almost hundredth of the world population. Probably, Instagram is catching up in terms of number of users too. In this world of shrinking distances, rapidly changing technology, monopoly of social media, people have gotten more used to having an impactful virtual presence rather than actually plucking up the courage and effort to talk to people in person.
As a result of all this, the display Picture has become a symbol of ego and pride. It symbolizes what we stand for, and represents our beliefs. We see people changing it at least twice a day, waiting in anticipation of the number of likes they might get on it, eagerly waiting to respond a thank you to people’s compliments and continuously refreshing the page to see how many people have viewed it. It shows how cool and happening our lives is, or how updated we are with current affairs, even though in reality we haven’t seen the back of a newspaper.
So many people are changing the color of their display picture in response to the terror attacks in France, but how is this going to help anyone? How will changing the display picture on social media make any impact other than showing to the world you know what has happened and sympathize with it on a very superficial level. A display picture with some semi clad kids in the background shows how aware you are of poverty and child labor.
Nonetheless, changing display picture is the call of the hour and wherever need exists, markets have responded to it to fuel the inherent profit motive of man. We have so many apps on mobiles that enable us to edit our photos. As if putting pictures of oneself that is nowhere near the true representation of what we are is not enough, we have all these beauty apps that help us to filter, edit, and actually

transform our picture into something it is not. We have always been taught to appreciate ourselves in our true form, not to lust after skin color, or a slim body or perfection. As long as we are comfortable in what we wear and do, it does not matter how our hair looks, how shiny our teeth is, or how pink are lips are. But it has become an unconscious trend for people to click pictures and immediately edit it on Instagram or any similar app that enhances the photo, stripping it of all its original qualities, and injecting pseudo-perfection into it. It does make the photo look very glamorous and professional, but where is the reality in that? Do we always have perfect make-up and hairdo? I don’t think so. There are times we just scrunch up our hair, and eat ice cream with groggy eyes, wearing our shabbiest pajamas. But the impression these pictures portray to the rest of the world is that we always look good, have awesome friends, and have a happening life. It is a sad situation.
Most people use these artificially enhanced images on dating sites as well. Imagine the harsh incredulity when that person is not recognizable in real life because they have put such different image online. Virtual reality is indeed dangerous because it allows us to be something we are truly not without being accountable for it. Plus, everyone is doing it so why not jump on the same boat. It creates a false illusion about oneself that is never healthy. It moves us farther away from reality, because we do not have perfectly kohl-lined eyes, or a full red pout, or high cheekbones. The sooner people realize this, the better it will be.
Take the case of India. Dark skin color has always plagued people, leading to launch of beauty products like fairness creams and face wash. Most of the young girls use editing apps to make themselves look fairer, or lighten their skin tone somehow. What good is this doing to their self-image? The belief that fair is beautiful is being entrenched by such actions. And social media propagates them. Some intervention is required very seriously to put an end to this pseudoprojection of self.
Just like everything else in the world, everything has two sides like a coin. It is

true that social media platforms like Instagram have been criticized due to the unrealistic goals that certain people set in order to make their lives or appearance like users who portray themselves as near to perfection. However the same way, there are many others who have been using the same platforms to work towards making a positive impact in the lives of others. It is important to acknowledge and accept this aspect of it as well.
The first benefit of this amazing application definitely has to be its actual purpose; to easily share and connect with friends in any part of the world. It is easy, fast and very user-friendly no matter who you are, where you are from or even how old you are. The application allows you to take high quality images of just about anything around you or even yourself and share it with the rest of the world. It is up to you to choose if your account is visible privately or to the public. While a public profile with extreme personal information might have a negative result if an ill-intentioned person comes across it, the account owner should just be a little more cautious in what they display. Otherwise, it is a great way to share the little and large joys that you experience in your everyday lives.
It is very effective in helping people to make a positive change in their lives. Instead of focusing on how beautiful and unrealistically perfect a person looks on their Instagram account, there are better aspects to actually notice. There are literally hundreds and thousands of profiles where health and fitness are focused upon. These pages could be personal profiles of a particular person who is very enthusiastic about it or it could be a profile where they just share images about other fitness focused people.
The way to let these influence you positively is not to try and look like someone in that picture. You need to focus on how much healthier and happier the person will be if they put in a little effort towards their personal health. You need to make similar efforts to put in those hours of exercise and eat a healthy diet. This will help you get a great body that is uniquely yours and does not have to look like theirs. The goal is not to look like another person but to be the best that you

can.
It is also a great platform for just about anyone to take pictures and share with everyone to show their creativity. It allows you to capture memories and also make some sort of art out of each picture that you click with. Over time, more and more people on Instagram have been experimenting with all the different concepts that they can try out on Instagram. This helps them to create a unique online presence for themselves where they can freely express them self.
Business on Instagram is yet another amazing aspect that has seen positive results. Quite a lot of profiles on Instagram are created for the purpose of business. Various brands, big companies and small setups alike realized the potential of Instagram to reach out to more people. This is why they create an account to showcase their products and services on Instagram. It allows them to reach the millions of users on the app and also have a much more personal interaction with them.
As you can see, the same app can have advantages that can outweigh the disadvantages depending on the viewpoint of the person. The impact of this one simple application on society has actually been enormous.

Chapter 10: How to Edit Pictures for Instagram?
The focal point of your Instagram account is the photos that you upload. Whether a user sees one single post or an overview of the entire profile, their impression will be based on the quality of your content. Hence, you need to make an extra effort to first dish out photos that everyone will love and envy.
For this very purpose, we will give you some tips and tricks to edit your pictures like a pro and make some attractive content for your account. Nobody on Instagram actually wants to look at blurry pictures taken in the dark where hardly anything can be made out. So let’s see how you can avoid this situation.
The first point to keep in mind is that your backdrop is important. If you want your image to focus on a particular subject, keep a clean background and minimal other things in the picture. The focus should be on that one subject. This is why using white walls or any solid backdrop works well.
Secondly, try to take as many pictures as you can during the day. Natural light is your best friend and will make your photo turn out well even before you start editing anything.
Once you have taken your pictures, use the tools inbuilt in Instagram or in other photo editing applications. There are so many to choose from that you would be spoilt for choice once you get started. Let’s look at some of the basic corrections you can make on the image.
The lux option in Instagram allows you to automatically make a balanced improvement in the picture without you fiddling individually with details like brightness and exposure. The slider can be used to adjust just how much of the effect you want to change in the picture.

Always avoid taking pictures in dark areas or in dim light. Try to get as much natural light as possible or look for other sources of light. For pictures taken at night, download application that will allow you to get better results when you take pictures in the dark. The tilt shift option is yet another option for improving your picture. You can tilt the plane of focus and adjust which part you want to blur out a bit. On the Instagram option you can choose between a radial or linear point of focus. You can also physically increase or decrease the area of this focus using your fingers. Straightening images is another option offered to users on the Instagram app. You might have taken a picture at a slightly wrong angle. With this option you can actually straighten it out. The grid in the app also allows you to have a clear look at how straight your lines in the photo are and help you do a better job of it. The sun can now set on a perfectly straight horizon thanks to this particular hack. Making collages from your pictures is an easy way to avoid spamming your followers feed with too many posts at once. You can download the Layout from Instagram app for this or use any other photo collage app that is available. There are so many layouts that you can choose from in order to get that perfect picture grid that you want for you Instagram post. Collages are can be fun and creative or just clean and sophisticated. There are many options for you to play with till you are satisfied with the result. Adjusting or changing the tint of the overall picture is yet another option. You can make a normal picture a black and white shot. You can adjust the depths of the black, whites and

grey in this as well. You can also adjust the tint to make it all more red or blue or even yellow. You can then adjust the extent of how much the photo gets tinted in that manner. Using all the inbuilt filters in the app is obviously the quickest and most popular choice for users. The filters available in Instagram are actually quite great and can make your pictures look much better. You can adjust certain things in the picture even after you add a filter to it. For instance you may add the sierra filter but then reduce the warmth or saturation in the picture using other tools. Readymade filters from many different applications can help you to make you Instagram posts look quite stunning and appear as though a professional photographer took them.

Tips for some great Instagram posts:
If your subject is food or your meal, the best trick in the handbook is to stand on top of your chair and take a picture from above. This gives a great photo of the meal in a clear and much more sophisticated way than take close-ups of the food. We can’t assure you that you yourself might look a little off the sophisticated scale while standing on that chair in a restaurant though. But it is definitely worth that momentary embarrassment when compared to all the Instagram glory you will be showered in. Make sure you brighten up the picture though since most food joints have lighting on the dimmer side. Increase the contrast, sharpen your photo and you’re good to go. Some unique walls are a great prop for your pictures as well. They could be plain white or even colored. The walls could be modern and clean or some part of an old brick building. Just make sure it is uniform and go pose to your heart’s content in front of these walls for way too many likes to not make you happy on that particular day. Minimal themes are yet another popular way to get attention. The point is to have the subject take up a small bit of space in the picture with nothing around it. Make the picture bright yet balanced. Travel shots are a win-win on almost any given day. You could choose to take photos of a cityscape or your picture could be of perfect scenery. For cityscapes, take the shot from the streets and show a particular scene. Make sure the clarity level is high. In case of scenery, try to focus on one thing like a tree and make it the focal point of the picture. Adjust the brightness and contrast accordingly.
Different applications that help to improve your photos:

VSCO Cam-This application has a lot of loyal users. Many of them use it for every single post that they upload on Instagram and it actually serves as their theme. You can customize the details in the picture and also choose from the great filters that this app has.
Overgram is another great app that allows you to add text in beautiful font on the photo that you want to upload. This is especially nice for pictures where you want to add quotes to give an insight into the subject.

Snapseed is a very popular app and why would it not be. It gives you so many options to edit the photo in a number of ways. There are so many tools on it and the end effect can make your photo look like a professional took it.

Chapter 11: How to Get More Followers on
Instagram?
One of the basic goals of establishing a successful presence on Instagram is to get as many followers and likes for your account as you possibly can. It actually is not all that hard and depends entirely on how you use the application. The following tips will help you gain more likes and also increase the number of followers from Instagram user base:
Firstly, you need to start liking as many photos or videos that other users post, as possible. This is one of the best ways to make people at least view your account and then accordingly like your pictures and even follow you. Like the posts of everyone who comes in your newsfeed, as this will make them feel inclined to return the favor as well. Now like or comment on as many popular pictures as you can. You should also like more posts with hash tags similar to the ones you used on your own post. This will generate the right kind of traffic for your page.
Yet another easy way is to tag your own posts with hash tags such as followme, followback, followforfollow, etc. Hence other users who use the same tags and want more followers as well will follow you. Now search for posts with these hash tags and go like their posts or follow them back as well.
Comment on as many photos of other users as you can. This is much more personal than just liking their posts. People are also more likely to notice your comment on their post than the random like you threw in. commenting is much more interactive and effective since you are adding a personal touch to it.
Captions are a great way to engage your followers and other users who view you posts thanks to the relevant hash tags you add as well. Make the

caption count and try to engage the viewer in it. You can add a story behind the picture. You can add a question asking users about their views on something or something similar. This could be anything from asking them how your hair looks in a picture to how useful they found a particular product of yours if it is a business account. In fact, if you as for reviews, it actually shows users that you are open to receiving real feedback. Your caption is also crucial when you are holding a photo contest or such. These are all call to action captions that demand the users to get engaged with your post.
One other way to keep followers and get new ones is to post consistently yet not too often. Being over active on Instagram will label you as someone who spam’s the users feed all the time. Nobody wants to see multiple posts from the same account in the span of 3 hours or even a day. Try to limit the number of times you upload something and ensure that these are actually quality content.
Use the analytics tool and find out when more people are active on Instagram. Choose these timings to upload your pictures since this will ensure that you get more likes and even more indirect views. This will generate more followers on your account as well. There are many apps like Iconosquare that help you for this analyzing purpose and will work to your benefit especially if you take your Instagram presence seriously.
Shout outs are another easy way to get a lot of followers at once. This can work to benefit two people at once. Get in touch with a user who has a lot of followers and ask them to give you a shout out on their account. All they basically have to do is share a post with you tagged in it and they ask their followers to follow you. Try to get them to post a picture that you shared on your account and to tag you as well as mention you in their caption. If the caption is interesting and persona, it works out even better. It should not look as though you are desperate for more followers. Similarly you can return the favor in kind. There are a lot of accounts that

actually just do shout outs for people who want a large number of followers for their account. Some of these promise quick results if you are willing to invest monetarily as well. There are certain apps and websites that also help you to get a large number of followers if you sign up with them.
Now if you let go of all those quick and easy methods to get a lot of fast followers, it all comes back to you and your account. Making a great Instagram account itself should be your main goal. There are quite a few tips and tricks that actually help to get more followers for your account. One of the first things that users get attracted to is a profile that has a theme. If you stick to a particular theme then the users know what to expect if they follow you. Stick to certain subjects and those who are genuinely interested in those will more than likely follow you and like your posts all the time. Try to choose the theme based on something that genuinely interests you. This will drive you further to stick to that theme. It could be anything from fitness and food to clouds or the color pink. However, choosing a theme is not a necessity. Just make sure that your content is as good and high quality as possible.
A profile picture and catchy username are yet another aspect that can work to your benefit. Choose the best profile picture of yourself or one with your brand name on it if it is a business account. The profile picture needs to be related to your accounts theme if you have one. The username should also be somehow related. The users should e able to connect with it and associate your username when they think of the subjects that your account deals with.
Use your bio section carefully and cleverly. It can give other Instagram users a quick view into who you are or what your account is about. Use some small phrase or a few appropriate words to describe what your account is exactly about. You can even add in the link to any other website that you own or manage in the bio section.

Another great way to get more followers is to follow other people yourself. Find people to follow from across Instagram by different methods. Firstly try to follow all those who are on your contact list and have an Instagram account. You should also link it to Facebook and follow your friends from there that have an Instagram account as well. The other users that you choose to follow should have similar interests like you. Try not to follow too many people at once. You should also try to keep the number of people you follow below the number of followers that you have. Users tend to shy away from following those who have more “following” than “followers”.
You can also get a lot more followers if you link your Instagram account to any other social media that you use. For instance, you can link it to your Facebook or twitter account. You can also share a link to your Instagram account on your blog or the company website. This makes more people see that you have an Instagram account and they just might follow you. You can also sync your posts with these sites like Tumblr and Foursquare. Just tick the box beside the options for sharing. Every time you post something on Instagram, it will automatically get posted on those accounts that are linked as well. You can also choose to o this for some specific posts and keep the sharing option turned off for other posts.
Hash tags are yet another important part in your Instagram experience. Users search for tags with words related to their interests and that is how they discover new accounts that they might choose to follow. There are two types of account users when it comes to how they use tags. Some like to use as many tags as Instagram will allow them to put per post. They then choose to use all of the most popularly searched words for their tags to generate traffic to their post. Since there are so many users who do this, it might actually work at least to get likes. These users use all kind of tags such as love, likeforlike, likeforfollow, followforfollow, etc. However, there are the other types of users who find such tactics desperate and

inappropriate. These users would rather use a few choice words for their tags that are actually relevant to their particular post. This drives users who have similar interests towards their page and they are the ones who are more likely to follow your Instagram account if the content is what they prefer for their news feed. For such users, make the hash tags specific to what type of traffic you want to generate towards your page. As long as these users like what you are posting, they will look forward to more of your posts and thus follow your account.
Like we mentioned above, tags play a very important role. If you would rather have a lot of followers fast and in a short period of time, use the popular tags. Popular tags are keywords that are searched for most commonly at a certain point in time. There are apps and analytics that tell you which words are being used for hash tags the most right then. You can then go ahead and se these hash tags to generate the maximum amount of traffic to your post. Using popular tags will make it possible for more people to see you post when they search for a particular tag. Even getting them to see you picture might just make them click on the post and like it. Here as well, having a post with good content will help. If your picture is attractive then it will catch the user’s eye regardless of what they were searching for. The tag does not have to be related to the subject of your picture. You can use just about any word that more users of Instagram tend to search for. Although many people look down upon this practice, it actually does show results.
Tagging the location of your pictures is also another option to generate traffic to your post. If the location is some place popular, there will be people who will search for other pictures of that same place. This will help direct those users to your account and post. Geotagging is a great personal touch to add to your pictures and makes it more authentic.
When it comes down to it, your content is what actually matters at the start as well as the end. The Instagram app is all about photos. You need

to take pictures of things that other people will find pleasing to look at. The photos should also be as high quality as possible. Firstly choose a particular subject for your post and take an attractive picture of it. If you have a theme, then stick to that. Take a number of pictures of the same subject from different angles to get the best shot. Then edit it to improve it further. Instagram has inbuilt editing options that you can use to your benefit. There are also many other applications that allow you to edit photos and videos quite nicely. Use these to your advantage and improve your feed. Even if your subject is something common, the way you present it can be different. Make it look good in natural light and focus on one particular thing. Anything around the subject should serve as a background. Take pictures from different angles and with a unique perspective to get that one perfect shot for your account. This is what will make people attracted to your account and make them follow you.

Chapter 12: How to Hold an Instagram Contest?
As we’ve mentioned quite a few times already, holding an Instagram contest can definitely work to your benefit. This contest concept has been noted to show positive results for nearly any business on Instagram as it generates a lot of customer interest.

The best part is that there are quite a few simple yet amazing types of contests that you can hold on your Instagram account. Read on to get a better idea of each.
Types of Instagram contests:
One simple and random type of contest is where you ask your users to follow and like a particular post. You can randomly choose a winner from amongst all the users who do so. Give a deadline till when the contest is valid and announce the winner after that. The prize you offer can be your own products and if they like it, it’s a returning customer for sure. This type of contest is a very simple way to gain more likes and followers at the same time. Another type of contest is where the users have to post a particular type of picture and use a specific hash tag relevant to your contest. The theme could be anything from asking users to post a picture of them or just wearing something like a pink dress. The user needs to upload the picture and tag your Instagram account. They also need to use the specific hash tag that you create for your contest. The next part is that the winner with the best picture and maximum number of likes on their post will be the winner. You can then choose the winner

after the contest deadline passes and announce the result on your page along with what you will be gifting them. It’s a simple and effective concept where the pictures are easy to take selfies. Most customers find such contests appealing and will participate every time you hold such events for the simple reason that it’s easy and they just might win. Yet another concept for those with an actual offline business is an instore photo contest. This works for brands or any shops which have an Instagram account and also an actual setup that customers can walk into. Your contest rules ask them to click pictures in your actual store and then upload the picture on Instagram. They have to tag your account and use the relevant hash tag. This allows you to lure in more customers as foot traffic into your store and engage them online as well. The contest timeline can be anything from a week to a month. A weekly period gives faster call to action and results. You can also allow the contest participants to enter through the website that you have as well as Instagram. Giving those more options means that you get more people who might or might not be using the other platform. Just make it clear that they can avail the option of either Instagram or the company website. Yet another type of photo contest is where it is required for the customer to upload a picture with your products. The post needs to show how they use your products and also include the contest specific hash tag. This way other people get to see more real people actually using your product. A lot of potential customers can be generated this way. The users will also make their personal effort of making the images appealing to their own followers as well as to the people judging the contest. It is also very brand related and is a good marketing strategy. You can then offer up your products to these participants for their loyalty value. One example of this could be if

you are a makeup company. Ask the users to create a particular look with your products and show what they have used clearly in their entry. It’s amazing to see how many people get interested in this manner and might go ahead to buy the same things.
As you can see, there are a lot of easy and creative ways in which you can utilize Instagram contests to your benefit. Everybody loves free gifts so entering a simple and fun Instagram contest would be quite appealing to most people. While you part with some simple stuff that you already have, you generate much more traffic that will pay to get the same stuff. The users don’t have to spend a penny to enter the contest and you earn more than tenfold of the one penny that you part with. So go ahead and try holding one contest from your account. The results are more than likely to be positive.
Use the following tips to hold a successful contest on your Instagram account:
Firstly set a proper goal or objective that you want to meet with your contest. Everything you do needs to have a purpose and positive result.
Now think clearly about the target customers that you want to reach through your contest. Your contest specifications will depend according to whom you want as your participant or future customer.
Depending on what your goal and target market is, decide what you will be giving away as a prize. It should be something that will make your followers and other users want to take part in the contest. The prize should also be decided depending on a budget that you should not cross. Just make sure that the incentive is such that it engages your target crowd.
The post that you put up to announce your contest should also be appealing and attention grabbing. You can also show the customers the prize that they will be getting if they win. Make it as attractive as possible.
According to the target customers that you want to reach out to, decide on what type of contest you are holding. You already know that there are different types of contests that you can hold and modify them creatively.

For instance if your brand sells tea, ask the users to upload selfies of themselves drinking from your particular brand of tea. Similarly decide on a particular unique theme for your contest.
Manage the contest by asking all the participants to use a specific hash tag that you create for your contest. They should also tag your account in the post so that you can keep track of all the entries. Make sure you set specific rules for any entries and only users who follow these will be eligible to participate in the contest. One of the basics is that they actually follow your Instagram account.
The hash tag for the contest is actually quite important. It should not be something that people commonly use. That would make it difficult to determine who is actually entering your contest. The unique contest hash tag makes a community just for your participants and they can view each other’s entries easily as well.
Set a deadline till when the contest is running and till when the entries will be accepted. Small weekly contests have been found to be quite engaging and productive. It keeps generating traffic and the investment does not have to be over the top either. If you prize is much bigger however, you can allow a longer deadline to make the users actually work for it. In case of such big prizes, you might choose to have terms such that the picture with the maximum likes would win the contest. This gives the participants more time to work towards the likes and allows more users to view your brand name as well. Make sure you also clearly mention on what basis you will be choosing the winners of the contest in order to avoid any confusion or conflict.
Depending on the results that you see from your contest, determine how often you want to hold them. If you see good and quick results with a lot more new customers, it makes it feasible to have frequent contests. Otherwise, take it a little slower like a monthly or seasonal contest.
To get more participants for your contest, promote it in as many forums

as possible. Announce the contest on your website or any other social media that you have a presence in. this could be anything from Facebook, twitter, etc. to a blog that you have. You can also make other popular account holders on Instagram announce the contest on their account. You can also use ads on Facebook or twitter and other such places that will allow more people to see what’s on offer.
Once your contests are up and running, monitor it closely. Use tools like Google analytics, Google alerts, Twitter analytics, or other such third party options. These will help you easily an effectively monitor your contest till it ends.
All you have to do when you choose the winner is contact them and announce it on your page. You can take it a better step further by uploading a great picture of the winner with the actual prize that you sent them. These makes more users interested and look forward to the next contest that you will be holding.
