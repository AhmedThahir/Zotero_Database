Using machine learning to improve our understanding of injury risk and prediction in elite male youth football players
Abstract
Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine whether the use of machine learning improved the ability of a neuromuscular screen to identify injury risk factors in elite male youth football players.
Methods: 355 elite youth football players aged 10 to 18 years old completed a prospective pre-season neuromuscular screen that included anthropometric measures of size, as well as single leg countermovement jump (SLCMJ), single leg hop for distance (SLHD), 75% hop distance and stick (75%Hop), Y-balance anterior reach and tuck jump assessment. Injury incidence was monitored over one competitive season. Risk profiling was assessed using traditional regression analyses and compared to supervised machine learning algorithms constructed using decision trees.
Results: Using continuous data, multivariate logistic analysis identified SLCMJ asymmetry as the 14 sole significant predictor of injury (OR 0.94, 0.92-0.97, p<0.001 with a specificity of 97.7% and sensitivity of 15.2% giving an AUC of 0.661. The best performing decision tree model provided a specificity of 74.2% and sensitivity of 55.6% with an AUC of 0.663. All variables contributed to the final machine model, with asymmetry in the SLCMJ, 75%Hop and Y-balance, plus tuck jump knee valgus and anthropometrics being the most frequent contributors.
Conclusions: Although both statistical methods reported similar accuracy, logistic regression provided very low sensitivity and only identified a single neuromuscular injury risk factor. The machine learning model provided much improved sensitivity to predict injury and identified interactions of asymmetry, knee valgus angle and body size as contributing factors to an injurious profile in youth football players.

1. INTRODUCTION
Injury rates in elite male youth football can be considered to be high, with recent evidence suggesting that injury rates in this population have increased substantially over the past 15 years due to increased exposure and earlier specialisation.1,2 Prospective studies have indicated that neuromuscular screening is associated with increased injury risk in professional female and male football players,3,4 in addition to being associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and lower extremity injury in elite youth football players.5,6 Given that neuromuscular control is modifiable,7 development of a sensitive neuromuscular screen to profile injury risk would be a useful tool to help inform intervention by practitioners.
The ability of a screen to identify injury risk factors and predict injury is often examined using logistic regression. Logistic regression does not manage imbalanced data sets well and tends to only consider the ability of one or a few variables to predict injury, yet it is acknowledged that injury is multifaceted and there will be interactions between and even within risks.3,8 For example, body size, maturity and neuromuscular control may all interact to influence injury risk in young populations. Consequently, it has been argued that the complexity of injury means a broader statistical approach than logistic regression is needed to better understand relationships between risk factors and predictors of injury.9
Machine learning offers a contemporary statistical approach where algorithms have been specifically designed to deal with imbalanced data sets and enable the modelling of interactions between a large number of variables.3 Contemporary empirical evidence has shown machine learning to provide promising results in the prediction of injury in adult football and handball players,3,10,11 and high levels of sensitivity in predicting injury in elite youth soccer players from measures of anthropometry and motor performance.8 To the authors’ knowledge, no previous research has provided a direct comparison of the sensitivity and specificity of different statistical approaches in their ability to detect injury risk in athletic populations, with only one existing study employing machine learning to predict injury risk in elite male youth football players.8 Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine whether the use of machine learning could improve the ability of a neuromuscular screen to predict injury and identify associations between injury risk factors in elite male youth football players.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Six professional English Premier League and Championship football clubs volunteered to take part. The clubs initially provided access to n = 400 players, of which n = 355 were tested and prospectively followed for one season, with n = 80 players in the U11s and U12s, n = 114 in the U13s and U14s, n = 117 in the U15s and U16s and n = 44 in the U18s. Participants were included in the study if they were free from illness and injury at the time of testing and regularly involved in training and competitions. Ethical approval was granted by the institutional ethics committee in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki. Parental consent to participate in the study was obtained together with assent from participants.
A prospective cohort study design was used. Following a familiarization session, players were required to attend their respective club’s training ground during the pre-season period (July) to undertake a field-based screening battery. Players were then tracked for a period of 10 months (August to June) during the 2014-2015 season to prospectively record all injuries sustained in training and competition. The ability of test variables to identify risk factors and predict injury was compared

using two different statistical methods; univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses versus a selection of popular machine learning methods.
Descriptive variables of chronological age, body mass, stature, leg length, BMI and estimated somatic maturity offset12 were included along with a battery of neuromuscular control tests; single leg countermovement jump (SLCMJ), single leg hop for distance (SLHD), 75% hop and stick (75%Hop), y-balance anterior reach distance and knee valgus during the tuck jump assessment. Protocols and reliability for all tests have been described elsewhere.13-16 The SLCMJ and 75%Hop were performed on a force plate (Pasco, Roseville, California, USA) and peak vertical ground reaction force were measured, with all variables reported relative to body weight.15,17 All tests were performed unilaterally with an asymmetry index calculated for SLCMJ, SLHD, 75%Hop and y-balance.6
The procedures for reporting injury occurrence have previously been described elsewhere.6 Injuries were recorded by medical staff at each football club in accordance with the Premier League’s Elite Player Performance Plan. Only non-contact lower-limb injuries were considered for the present study. Injuries were recorded where they resulted from football-related activities and resulted in a player being unable to participate in training or competition for at least 48 hours post incident, not including the day of injury. An injury was classified as non-contact where no clear contact or collision with another player, object or ball occurred. Due to the confounding effects of previous injuries,18,19 only the first incident experienced by each player during the season was used in the analyses.4
Following a traditional statistical approach, a univariate binary logistic regression for each variable was employed. Neuromuscular and anthropometric risk factors that displayed a p value < 0.1 were considered for further analysis in a multivariate binary logistic regression. Prior to the multivariate analysis the absence of multicollinearity between variables was confirmed using linear regression, with a voluntary inflation factor of <10 indicating independence between variables. The odds ratio (OR) for each risk factor in the univariate and multivariate analyses were calculated to show the odds of increased injury per unit increase in the independent variable, along with 95% confidence intervals (CI), together with the area under the curve (AUC) with 95% CIs, sensitivity and specificity. This process was repeated for the univariate and multivariate analysis with all variables first analysed as continuous data and secondly as categorical data based on the discretization process described below.
In the contemporary modelling approach, supervised machine learning was employed. Prior to analysis, continuous data were discretized as this can improve the performance of decision trees.20 Discretization categories for each variable are shown in Table 1. Participants were split into four age groups as per previous research.6 A single cut-off was applied to asymmetry measures to indicate participants more at risk of injury. Cut-off values for increased injury risk were based on values proposed in previous research; y-balance ≥ 4 cm,16,21 SLCMJ, SLHD and 75%Hop asymmetry all ≥ 10%.22 The maturity offset was used to categorise participants as pre (>-1 y), circa (-1 to +1 y) and post (>+1 y) peak height velocity. Knee valgus was categorised as being either absent (≤0ᵒ), minor (19ᵒ), moderate (10-20ᵒ) or severe (>20ᵒ).23 Following the procedures of Lopez-Valenciano et al.,3 the remaining variables were discretized into four intervals using the unsupervised discretization algorithm available in Weka (Waikato Environment Knowledge Analysis).

Three widely used classic decision tree algorithms were chosen as base classifiers; J48 consolidated 123 (J48con), an alternating decision tree (ADT) and a reduces error pruning tree (REPTree), with further 124 algorithms then applied to reduce class imbalance. To address the issue of imbalance and skewed 125 distributions, four resampling, three classic ensemble, three bagging ensemble, three boosting 126 ensemble and five cost-sensitive algorithms were applied to the data. A brief description of each of 127 the techniques employed is provided in supplementary Table S1 and further descriptions of the 128 techniques used are provided by Lopez-Valenciano et al.3 With all algorithms applied to all base 129 classifiers, a total of 57 models were generated. To allow comparison of the constructed models to a 130 baseline model a ZeroR classifier was also used.

The number of internal classifiers was set at 10 for all ensemble techniques. Thus, each model built by each ensemble technique contained 10 classifying decision trees, each contributed a vote of “yes” or “no” as to whether a participant will get injured. With non-boosting techniques the number of yes/no votes was used to obtain the final prediction, with ≥5 “yes” votes classifying a participant as injured. With boosting techniques each vote was weighted and all votes summed to provide the final prediction, with a summed value >0 classifying a participant as injured. In order to evaluate the performance of the models the data was split into five sets and the five-fold stratified cross validation technique used. For each set, the algorithm was trained with the examples contained in the remaining four sets and then tested with the current set. The AUC was used to evaluate overall accuracy together with the specificity and sensitivity of each model. Cross-validation was used to choose the best performing machine model based on achieving high sensitivity and accuracy.

3. RESULTS
Participants had a mean age of 14.3 ± 2.1 y, mass of 54.3 ± 13.5 kg, stature of 162.4 ± 14.3 cm, leg length of 86.6 ± 8.2 cm and maturity offset of 0.11 ± 1.93 y. A total of n = 99 players suffered a first non-contact lower extremity injury during the competitive season. Over three quarters of injuries were classified as either moderate or severe (82%), with the remainder minor or slight. There were a high proportion of strain type injuries (35%), with ligament (17%) and growth/overuse (14%) the most prevalent thereafter.

Results of the univariate analysis for continuous data are presented in Table 2, showing that age, SLCMJ peak force on the right leg, SLCMJ asymmetry and 75%Hop asymmetry were all significantly associated with injury. SLCMJ asymmetry provided an AUC of 0.645 (0.577-0.712) with a sensitivity of 11.1% and specificity of 97.7%. For all other variables, the AUC was ≤ 0.58 (95%CIs 0.433-0.645) with a sensitivity of 0% and specificity of 100%. No multicollinearity was present and the multivariate analysis included four variables, providing an AUC of 0.661 (0.5960.725) with a specificity of 97.7% and sensitivity of 15.2%. In that model only SLCMJ asymmetry provided a significant contribution (p < 0.001, OR = 0.94, 0.92-0.94), with non-significant contributions from 75% Hop asymmetry (p = 0.10, OR = 0.98, 0.95-1.00), SLCMJ relative peak force on the right leg (p = 0.13,OR = 0.72, 0.48-1.10) and age (p = 0.36, OR = 1.06, 0.94-1.20).

Predictive ability was similar when logistic regression was performed on categorical data; in the univariate analysis all variables reported an AUC ≤ 0.57 (95% CIs 0.435-0.641) with a sensitivity of 0% and specificity of 100%. With the absence of collinearity, a multivariate analysis including height, 75%Hop asymmetry, SLCMJ on the right leg and asymmetry, Y-balance on both the left and right leg and tuck jump knee valgus on the left leg provided a prediction with a specificity of 94.5% and sensitivity of 11.1% and an AUC of 0.687 (0.627-0.747). The multivariate analysis is available in Supplementary Table S2 and shows SLCMJ PVRGF on the right leg as the only significant predictor across groups (all OR 0.49, 0.25 – 0.98).

With machine learning, the baseline ZeroR classifier achieved an AUC of 0.494, specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 0%. Supplementary Tables S3, S4 and S5 show the performance of the different decision trees for the resampling, ensemble and cost-sensitive machine learning techniques respectively, nearly all of which have greater accuracy and sensitivity than the baseline model. The bagging ensemble method with a J48con decision tree as a base classifier and a 1:1 cost sensitive

learning matrix was chosen as the best performing decision tree model. Cross-validation showed an AUC of 0.663 (0.550-0.776) with the model correctly classifying 74.2% of non-injured and 55.6% of injured players. All classifiers from the final model are available in supplementary Figures S1-S10, with Figure S1 showing a decision pathway for an example player. Table 3 shows the frequency with which each of the 20 risk factors appeared across the 10 classifiers in the final model. SLCMJ asymmetry appeared in all classifiers, with SLHD asymmetry, hop and stick (75%Hop) asymmetry and knee valgus on the left leg identified as other frequently included neuromuscular risks (≥7/10). A number of descriptive measures also appeared frequently in the final model, including age, body mass, stature and leg length.

4. DISCUSSION
The aim of the present study was to examine whether the use of machine learning improved the ability to identify injury risk factors and predict injury in a cohort of elite male youth football players. Machine learning did not improve the overall accuracy of injury prediction. However, logistic regression was heavily biased towards the majority class of non-injured players and provided poor sensitivity, whereas machine learning provided a more balanced predictive model with sensitivity to predict injury improving more than 3.5 -fold. Whether using continuous or categorical data, multivariate logistic regression only identified a single significant predictor of injury and improved sensitivity in the machine learning model may reflect a better ability of that model to consider interactions between risk factors. All variables appeared multiple times in the final machine learning model, suggesting the importance of interactions between asymmetry, movement control and body size as injury risk factors in elite youth football.

It has been suggested that using logistic regression does not control well for imbalanced data sets when predicting injury.3 This seems to be the case in the present study with all univariate analyses showing perfect to near perfect specificity but low to zero sensitivity, indicating a good ability to identify individuals who did not get injured but not those who did get injured. Similarly, multivariate logistic regression using both continuous data and categorical data achieved low levels of sensitivity

(≤15.2%) with both approaches only identifying one significant predictor of injury. The absence of other significant contributing variables suggests that multivariate logistic regression may not be proficient at quantifying interactions between risk factors.
The identification of relatively few significant predictor variables with logistic regression may be partly due to pooling of data for elite youth players across a broad range of age groups comprising different stages of maturation. In U14 to U16 age groups younger players experience more overuse injuries,24 while in U11 to U14 late maturing players experience more overuse injuries.25 Using a similar screen to the present study, Read et al.6 recently reported that maturity offset was the only variable significantly associated with injury in U13-U14 y old players (OR = 0.58), while heightened SLCMJ asymmetry (OR = 0.90) and lower relative SLCMJ peak force (OR = 0.36) were significantly associated with injury in the U11-12 and U15-16 age categories respectively. Given the complex interaction of growth, maturity timing and tempo, and injury the pooling of data across players of varying age and maturity in the present study may have reduced the ability of logistic regression to successfully identify participants who experienced an injury.
The AUC indicated that machine learning models also had poor overall accuracy to detect injury. This is similar to a previous study examining hamstring strain in elite Australian footballers, which reported that both logistic regression and machine learning achieved low overall accuracy (AUC < 0.60).26 A recent review of clinical diagnostic tools also reported no advantage of machine learning over logistic regression on overall accuracy.27 However, researchers should not focus solely on the AUC, but also consider the need for higher sensitivity,28 as identifying players with an increased risk of injury should be a priority. With the imbalanced data set used in the current study, it appears relatively easy to construct models with high specificity but more difficult to create models with high sensitivity. With the chosen machine learning model, the sensitivity was improved over 3.5 fold, with the model identifying all variables as contributing to injury risk.
Similar to the recent work of Rommers et al.8 but with lower sensitivity, our machine learning model identified measures of size as important predictors of injury in youth soccer, although our model also noted asymmetry and valgus often contribute to an injurious profile. This may be important as young football players are known to exhibit lower limb asymmetries and reduced frontal plane knee control23,29 and these are likely to be modifiable risk factors. Our modelling process used information entropy to identify attributes that provided the greatest normalized gain in predicting injury, with subsequent pruning of the decision tree to reduce complexity and over-fitting, remove noisy data and improve predictions. This means that classifiers from the model are relatively straight forward to follow. For our sample population results would suggest that interventions that consider size, maturity, asymmetry and movement control may be useful to reduce injury. Where an individual player is identified at risk of injury practitioners should further explore test results to identify which decision tree classifiers and features contributed to that outcome, which neuromuscular risk factors within those classifiers could be modified to reduce risk and which non-modifiable factors may need to be managed (e.g. by reducing exposure).
In the logistic regression analysis data imbalance was not adjusted and results were validated in the population with which the predictive equations were generated, which will create a bias and inflate the overall accuracy. The machine learning adopted a more robust stratified cross-validation approach, making accuracy more difficult to achieve. The statistical approaches used were purposely chosen to reflect the manner in which they are typically applied to injury profiling and prediction. To maintain sample size and reduce overfitting, the present study examined all non-contact lower limb

injuries and did not focus on a particular injury type or severity classification. A focus on a single injury type (e.g. ACL) or classification (e.g. muscle injury) has been shown to provide better accuracy in previous research using logistic regression5 and machine learning,3,10 but this approach would have led to data reduction and greater data imbalance.
5. CONCLUSION
The ability to predict injury and our understanding of the factors that contribute to injury risk are influenced by the statistical approaches used to analyse prospective data, which may then influence practice. Most likely due to the complex nature of injury occurrence and prediction, achieving a high level of overall accuracy may be difficult with both logistic regression (whether using continuous or categorical data) and machine learning approaches. If more importance is placed on sensitivity (rather than specificity) then machine learning may offer a promising method to predict injury, while also providing a deeper understanding of the interaction between variables that contribute to injury risk. In the cohort examined, machine learning suggested that asymmetry, knee valgus angle, age and size all contribute to injury risk in elite male youth football players. Given that movement mechanics and asymmetry are modifiable qualities, these findings may help guide injury prevention practice and future research.
6. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
• Machine learning improved the sensitivity of injury prediction more than 3.5-fold compared to multivariate logistic regression analyses.
• Asymmetry, movement control, maturity and size all interact to influence injury risk in elite male youth football players, supporting the need to screen for a variety of risk factors and consider results collectively.
• Given that movement control (e.g. knee valgus) and asymmetry are modifiable neuromuscular risk factors, at risk players may benefit from interventions that target deficits in these qualities.

Description

Resampling

Smote I

Synthetic minority oversampling technique is an oversampling method,

whose main idea is to create new minority class examples by

interpolating several minority class instances that lie together. SMOTE

creates instances by randomly selecting one (or more de- pending on the

oversampling ratio) of the k nearest neighbors (kNN) of a minority class

Smote II

instance and the generation of the new instance values from a random

interpolation of both instances. In this study, each decision tree applied

on data set previously pre-processed with Smote.

They were considered using the k-3 and k-5 nearest neighbour of

minority class instances using the Euclidean distance

Random Oversampling with random over sampling technique, a filter that duplicates some

(ROS)

random minority instances until the total amount of minority instances

reaches the percentage given.

majority instances until the total amount of majority instances reaches

the percentage given

Ensemble

Classic AdaBoost, without using confidences.

AdaBoost uses the whole data-set to train each classifier serially, but

after each round, it gives more focus to difficult instances, with the goal

of correctly classifying examples in the next iteration that were

incorrectly classified during the current iteration. Hence, it gives more

Adaboost

focus to examples that are harder to classify, the quantity of focus is measured by a weight, which initially is equal for all instances. After

each iteration, the weights of misclassified instances are increased while

the weights of correctly classified instances are decreased. Furthermore,

another weight is assigned to each individual classifier depending on its

overall accuracy which is then used in the test phase; more confidence

is given to more accurate classifiers. Finally, when a new instance is

submitted, each classifier gives a weighted vote, and the class label is selected by majority. Multi-class AdaBoost, slightly different weight update. Classic Bagging, resampling with replacement, bag size equal to original data set size. It consists in training different classifiers with bootstrapped replicas of the original training dataset. That is, a new data-set is formed to train each classifier by randomly drawing (with replacement) instances from the original data-set (usually, maintaining the original data-set size). Hence, diversity is obtained with the resampling procedure by the usage of different data subsets. Finally, when an unknown instance is presented to each individual classifier, a majority or weighted vote is used to infer the class. AdaBoost.M2 with Smote in each iteration. The weights of the new instances are proportional to the total number of instances in the new data-set. Hence, their weights are always the same (in all iterations and for all new instances), whereas original data-set’s instances weights are normalized in such a way that they form a distribution with the new instances. After training a classifier, the weights of the original data-set instances are updated; then another sampling phase is applied (again, modifying the weight distribution). The repetition of this process also brings along more diversity in the training data, which generally benefits the ensemble learning. AdaBoost.M2 with random undersampling in each iteration. RUSboost performs similarly to SmoteBoost, but it removes instances from the majority class by random undersampling the dataset in each iteration. It is not necessary to assign new weights to the instances. It is enough with simply normalizing the weights of the remaining instances in the new dataset with respect to their total sum of weights. AdaBoost.M2 with random oversampling in each iteration. Similar to RUSboost, but it creates instances from the minority class by random oversampling the dataset in each iteration. Bagging with oversampling of the minority class. Instead of performing a random sampling of the whole dataset, an oversampling process can be carried out before training each classifier. Bagging with undersampling of the majority class.
