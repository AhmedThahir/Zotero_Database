This paper demonstrates our work on the building of a generalized predictive model for predicting the results of the English Premier League. Using feature engineering and exploratory data analysis, we create a feature set for determining the most important factors for predicting the results of a football match, and consequently create a highly accurate predictive system using machine learning. We demonstrate the strong dependence of our models‚Äô performances on important features. Our best model using gradient boosting achieved a performance of 0.2156 on the ranked probability score (RPS) metric for game weeks 6 to 38 for the English Premier League aggregated over two seasons (2014‚Äì2015 and 2015‚Äì2016), whereas the betting organizations that we consider (Bet365 and Pinnacle Sports) obtained an RPS value of 0.2012 for the same period.

In this paper, we explore the techniques that have been applied to the challenges within team sports thus far. We focus on a number of different areas, namely match outcome prediction, tactical decision making, player investments, fantasy sports, and injury prediction. By assessing the work in these areas, we explore how AI is used to predict match outcomes and to help sports teams improve their strategic and tactical decision making.

This conclusion is also confirmed by the correlation analysis based on all the 153 matches: The correlation between the number of goals and the goal efficiency is found to be much stronger than the correlation between the number of goals and the number of shots.

Methods: in this research, we defined numerous parameters for player assessment, and three definitions of a successful transfer. We used the Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and AdaBoost algorithms in order to predict the player transfer success. We used realistic, publicly available data in order to train and test the classifiers. Results: in the article, we present numerous experiments; they differ in the weights of parameters, the successful transfer definitions, and other factors. We report promising results (accuracy = 0.82, precision = 0.84, recall = 0.82, and F1-score = 0.83).

The researchers described the descriptive statistics for all the soccer factors. They tested normality and homogeneity by Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Levene‚Äôs controls respectively. Furthermore, they examined the differences between wide and short range results by ANOVA analyses and post hoc Tukey‚Äôs comparisons. The results showed that in wide range results (‚â•3 difference), the winners perform significant higher performance than the losers in the following factors: aerial duels (p{$<$} .10), overall duels (p{$<$} .10), ball possession (p{$<$} .05), overall passes (p{$<$} .05), opponent-half passing accuracy (p{$<$} .05), overall shots (p{$<$} .001), shot accuracy (p{$<$} .10), on-target shots (p{$<$} .001), short distance (p{$<$} .001) and long distance shots (p{$<$} .05), as well corners (p{$<$} .05). No differences between winners and losers were found regarding the above variables in short range results.

This paper uses data on team payrolls in Major League Baseball between 1980 and 2000 to examine the link and implements Granger causality tests to establish whether the relationship runs from payroll to performance or vice versa. While there is no evidence that causality runs from payroll to performance over the entire sample period, the data shows that the cross section correlation between payroll and performance increased significantly in the 1990s. As a comparison, the paper examines the relationship between pay and performance in English soccer, and it is shown that Granger causality from higher payrolls to better performance cannot be rejected.

Most coaches have been affected, to a greater or lesser extent, by the tactics referred to as the ‚Äò‚Äòlong-ball game‚Äô‚Äô or ‚Äò‚Äòdirect play‚Äô‚Äô, which was a tactic employed as a consequence of this research. Data from these studies, published in the late 1960s, have been reconfirmed by analyses of different FIFA World Cup tournaments by several different research groups. In the present study, the number of passes that led to goals scored in two FIFA World Cup finals were analysed. The results conform to that of previous research, but when these data were normalized with respect to the frequency of the respective lengths of passing sequences, there were more goals scored from longer passing sequences than from shorter passing sequences. Teams produced significantly more shots per possession for these longer passing sequences, but the strike ratio of goals from shots is better for ‚Äò‚Äòdirect play‚Äô‚Äô than for ‚Äò‚Äòpossession play‚Äô‚Äô. Finally, an analysis of the shooting data for successful and unsuccessful teams for different lengths of passing sequences in the 1990 FIFA World Cup finals indicated that, for successful teams, longer passing sequences produced more goals per possession than shorter passing sequences. For unsuccessful teams, neither tactic had a clear advantage. It was further concluded that the original work of Reep and Benjamin (1968), although a key landmark in football analysis, led only to a partial understanding of the phenomenon that was investigated.},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {H\\:\\\\My Drive\\\\projects\\\\zotero\\\\storage\\\\28NF8IQ5\\\\Hughes and Franks - 2005 - Analysis of passing sequences, shots and goals in .pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229108791,"version":0},"$loki":164},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":540,"entry":"@online{IntroductionERModel2015,\n  title = {Introduction of {{ER Model}}},\n  date = {2015-10-13T17:49:04+00:00},\n  url = {https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-er-model/},\n  urldate = {2022-04-28},\n  abstract = {A Computer Science portal for geeks.

However, such a study has not been conducted in football (soccer) so far. The purpose of this research was to study whether data mined from Twitter can be used for this purpose. We built a set of predictive models for the outcome of football games of the English Premier League for a 3 month period based on tweets and we studied whether these models can overcome predictive models which use only historical data and simple football statistics. Moreover, combined models are constructed using both Twitter and historical data. The final results indicate that data mined from Twitter can indeed be a useful source for predicting games in the Premier League. The final Twitter-based model performs singificantly better than chance when measured by Cohen‚Äôs kappa and is comparable to the model that uses simple statistics and historical data. Combining both models raises the performance higher than it was achieved by each individual model.

On the one hand, playing football has become a high-income profession and the players are highly motivated; on the other hand, stronger teams have higher incomes and therefore afford better players leading to an even stronger appearance in tournaments that can make the game more imbalanced and hence predictable. To quantify and document this observation, in this work, we take a minimalist network science approach to measure the predictability of football over 26 years in major European leagues. We show that over time, the games in major leagues have indeed become more predictable. We provide further support for this observation by showing that inequality between teams has increased and the home-field advantage has been vanishing ubiquitously.

Through literature reviews it is observed that machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be used predict the performance of football player. But which model would be more efficient considering the positions of the player is not considered in any article. The proposed model has designed separate model as per the position of the player during the game. This can help to predict the player's performance as per their playing position.

Design Prospective cohort study. Methods 355 elite youth football players aged 10‚Äì18 years old completed a prospective pre-season neuromuscular screen that included anthropometric measures of size, as well as single leg countermovement jump (SLCMJ), single leg hop for distance (SLHD), 75\\% hop distance and stick (75\\%Hop), Y-balance anterior reach and tuck jump assessment. Injury incidence was monitored over one competitive season. Risk profiling was assessed using traditional regression analyses and compared to supervised machine learning algorithms constructed using decision trees. Results Using continuous data, multivariate logistic analysis identified SLCMJ asymmetry as the sole significant predictor of injury (OR 0.94, 0.92‚Äì0.97, p{$<$}0.001), with a specificity of 97.7\\% and sensitivity of 15.2\\% giving an AUC of 0.661. The best performing decision tree model provided a specificity of 74.2\\% and sensitivity of 55.6\\% with an AUC of 0.663. All variables contributed to the final machine model, with asymmetry in the SLCMJ, 75\\%Hop and Y-balance, plus tuck jump knee valgus and anthropometrics being the most frequent contributors. Conclusions Although both statistical methods reported similar accuracy, logistic regression provided very low sensitivity and only identified a single neuromuscular injury risk factor. The machine learning model provided much improved sensitivity to predict injury and identified interactions of asymmetry, knee valgus angle and body size as contributing factors to an injurious profile in youth football players.},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {Binary logistic regression,Neuromuscular,Prospective,Screen},\n  file = {H\\:\\\\My Drive\\\\projects\\\\zotero\\\\storage\\\\HIYJYNME\\\\Oliver et al_2020_Using machine learning to improve our understanding of injury risk and.pdf;H\\:\\\\My Drive\\\\projects\\\\zotero\\\\storage\\\\7RLD6CN4\\\\S1440244019316767.html}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229108951,"version":0},"$loki":198},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":463,"entry":"@online{OrdinaryDifferentialEquation,\n  title = {Ordinary Differential Equation | Mathematics | {{Britannica}}},\n  url = {https://www.britannica.com/science/ordinary-differential-equation},\n  urldate = {2022-04-11},\n  file = {H\\:\\\\My Drive\\\\projects\\\\zotero\\\\storage\\\\5SMJT55U\\\\ordinary-differential-equation.html}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229108952,"version":0},"$loki":199},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":106,"entry":"@incollection{pelechrinisLinNetProbabilisticLineup2019,\n  title = {{{LinNet}}: {{Probabilistic Lineup Evaluation Through Network Embedding}}},\n  shorttitle = {{{LinNet}}},\n  booktitle = {Machine {{Learning}} and {{Knowledge Discovery}} in {{Databases}}},\n  author = {Pelechrinis, Konstantinos},\n  editor = {Brefeld, Ulf and Curry, Edward and Daly, Elizabeth and MacNamee, Brian and Marascu, Alice and Pinelli, Fabio and Berlingerio, Michele and Hurley, Neil},\n  date = {2019},\n  series = {Lecture {{Notes}} in {{Computer Science}}},\n  volume = {11053},\n  pages = {20--36},\n  publisher = {{Springer International Publishing}},\n  location = {{Cham}},\n  doi = {10.1007/978-3-030-10997-4_2},\n  url = {http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-030-10997-4_2},\n  urldate = {2022-02-01},\n  abstract = {Which of your team‚Äôs possible lineups has the best chances against each of your opponent‚Äôs possible lineups? To answer this question, we develop LinNet (which stands for LINeup NETwork). LinNet exploits the dynamics of a directed network that captures the performance of lineups during their matchups. The nodes of this network represent the different lineups, while an edge from node B to node A exists if lineup ŒªA has outperformed lineup ŒªB. We further annotate each edge with the corresponding performance margin (point margin per minute). We then utilize this structure to learn a set of latent features for each node (i.e., lineup) using the node2vec framework. Consequently, using the latent, learned features, LinNet builds a logistic regression model for the probability of lineup ŒªA outperforming lineup ŒªB. We evaluate the proposed method by using NBA lineup data from the five seasons between 2007-08 and 2011-12. Our results indicate that our method has an out-of-sample accuracy of 68\\%. In comparison, utilizing simple network centrality metrics (i.e., PageRank) achieves an accuracy of just 53\\%, while using the adjusted plus-minus of the players in the lineup for the same prediction problem provides an accuracy of only 55\\%. We have also explored the adjusted lineups‚Äô plus-minus as our predictors and obtained an accuracy of 59\\%. Furthermore, the probability output of LinNet is well-calibrated as indicated by the Brier score and the reliability curve. One of the main benefits of LinNet is its generic nature that allows it to be applied in different sports since the only input required is the lineups‚Äô matchup network, i.e., not any sport-specific features are needed.},\n  isbn = {978-3-030-10996-7 978-3-030-10997-4},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {H\\:\\\\My Drive\\\\projects\\\\zotero\\\\storage\\\\9DJ54N3V\\\\Pelechrinis - 2019 - LinNet Probabilistic Lineup Evaluation Through Ne.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229108953,"version":0},"$loki":200},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":579,"entry":"@online{PrinciplesProgrammingLanguages,\n  title = {Principles of {{Programming Languages}}},\n  url = {https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/principles-of-programming-languages-gq/},\n  urldate = {2022-12-03},\n  abstract = {A Computer Science portal for geeks.

It assesses whether entries into the penalty area are influenced by match status, a player‚Äôs dismissal and the respective quality of the competing teams. Two observers analysed the relation between defensive and offensive strategies and their scoring consequences for all 64 matches played in the 2006 World Cup. Kappa values ranged between 0.93 and 0.98 for intra-reliability and between 0.88 and 0.98 for inter-reliability. It was found that winning teams received significantly fewer entries into their own penalty area (mean 041.42, s 011.86) than drawing (mean 050.07, s014.75) and losing teams (mean 047.23, s 012.14). Teams that received more entries into their own penalty area than the opposing team were significantly more likely to concede a goal (P B 0.001). Teams losing by one (mean 00.41, s00.21), two (mean 00.42, s00.26) or more than two goals (mean 00.34, s 00.13) received significantly fewer entries into the penalty area per minute than teams winning by one (mean 00.55, s00.27) or two goals (mean 00.59, s 00.39). Teams with fewer players on the pitch received significantly more entries into the penalty area per minute than teams with more (mean 00.22, s 00.07) or the same number (mean 00.14, s00.05) of players. Based on these results, it is suggested that teams should enter the opposing team‚Äôs penalty area but should not allow their opponents to do the same. These results also highlight the significance of the dismissal of a player.},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {H\\:\\\\My Drive\\\\projects\\\\zotero\\\\storage\\\\5TFHY2UH\\\\Ruiz-Ruiz et al. - 2013 - Analysis of entries into the penalty area as a per.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229109001,"version":0},"$loki":213},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":548,"entry":"@video{rylanfowersPythonSympyIntegrals2019,\n  title = {Python {{Sympy Integrals}}},\n  editor = {{Rylan Fowers}},\n  date = {2019-07-01},\n  url = {https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG6FrqeR1QM},\n  urldate = {2022-05-07},\n  abstract = {SYMPY Integrals Hello everyone, in this video we will compute integrals, including double integrals, using python. After we import SYMPY we write the init printing in order to get that nice latex-like output.  Just as a quick example let‚Äôs do x\\^2. Which of course integrates to x\\^3/3. Now lets create a function with two variables. x\\^2 and y\\^2. We can integrate this in terms of y and we can integrate this in terms of x.  Now lets say we want to do a double integral of dx then dy. We just nest the intergral function. And if we want to see any of these integrals evaluated we just need to put in a tuple with the lower and upper bounds.  And lastly, if we want to see exactly what we are integrating we can change it to Integral with a capital I. Here is the outside integral. And if we want to see the double integral we can do that as well. There you have it that is how you can use python to compute integrals    symbolically with sympy.

One of the open problems in this field is the valuation of football players. The aim of this study is to establish a football player value assessment model using machine learning techniques to support transfer decisions of football clubs. The proposed models will mainly be based on the intrinsic features of the individual players which are provided in Football Manager video game. To do this, based on the individual statistics of 5316 players who are active in 11 different major leagues from Europe and South America, different value assessment models are conducted using advanced supervised learning techniques like ridge and lasso regressions, random forests and extreme gradient boosting. All the models have been built in R programming language. The performances of the models are compared based on their mean squared errors. An ensemble model with inflation is proposed as the output.},\n  isbn = {978-3-030-23755-4 978-3-030-23756-1},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {H\\:\\\\My Drive\\\\projects\\\\zotero\\\\storage\\\\HSLI8LFV\\\\Yiƒüit et al. - 2020 - Football Player Value Assessment Using Machine Lea.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229109112,"version":0},"$loki":230},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":90,"entry":"@article{zouBayesianInPlayPrediction2020,\n  title = {A {{Bayesian In-Play Prediction Model}} for {{Association Football Outcomes}}},\n  author = {Zou, Qingrong and Song, Kai and Shi, Jian},\n  date = {2020-01},\n  journaltitle = {Applied Sciences},\n  volume = {10},\n  number = {8},\n  pages = {2904},\n  publisher = {{Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute}},\n  doi = {10.3390/app10082904},\n  url = {https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/8/2904},\n  urldate = {2021-12-21},\n  abstract = {Point process models have made a significant contribution to the prediction of football association outcomes. It is conventionally the case that defence and attack capabilities have been assumed to be constant during a match and estimated against the average performance of all other teams in history. Drawing upon a Bayesian method, this paper proposes a dynamic strength model which relaxes assumption of the constant teams\\&rsquo; strengths and permits applying in-match performance information to calibrate them. An empirical study demonstrates that although the Bayesian model fails to achieve improvement in goal difference prediction, it registers clear achievements with regard to the prediction of the total number of goals and Win/Draw/Loss outcome prediction. When the Bayesian model bets against the SBOBet bookmaker, one of the most popular gaming companies among Asian handicaps fans, whose odds data were obtained from both the Win/Draw/Loss market and over\\&ndash;under market, it may obtain positive returns; this clearly contrasts with the process model with constant strengths, which fails to win money from the bookmaker.},\n  issue = {8},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {adjusting forecast,association football,bayesian inference,betting market,in-play prediction,point process model},\n  file = {H\\:\\\\My Drive\\\\projects\\\\zotero\\\\storage\\\\ZSBIW4W2\\\\Zou et al_2020_A Bayesian In-Play Prediction Model for Association Football Outcomes.pdf;H\\:\\\\My Drive\\\\projects\\\\zotero\\\\storage\\\\TRUKAHHH\\\\2904.html}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229109115,"version":0},"$loki":231}],"idIndex":null,"binaryIndices":{"itemID":{"name":"itemID","dirty":true,"values":[51,69,72,73,88,121,119,106,21,90,10,28,108,17,76,105,82,70,30,14,16,37,53,15,81,114,35,110,45,42,34,18,74,63,20,103,11,33,40,54,27,92,89,5,102,101,4,7,97,3,93,6,75,47,117,41,86,115,71,67,23,80,68,49,109,58,48,32,25,8,116,24,39,65,111,98,61,60,62,59,99,79,50,19,12,84,107,85,55,100,56,44,87,2,26,113,104,1,0,9,57,112,77,29,78,13,83,36,94,31,66,46,91,43,96,118,64,52,95,22,38,120]},"exportNotes":{"name":"exportNotes","dirty":true,"values":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120]},"useJournalAbbreviation":{"name":"useJournalAbbreviation","dirty":true,"values":[]},"asciiBibLaTeX":{"name":"asciiBibLaTeX","dirty":true,"values":[]},"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":{"name":"biblatexExtendedNameFormat","dirty":true,"values":[]},"DOIandURL":{"name":"DOIandURL","dirty":true,"values":[]}},"constraints":null,"uniqueNames":[],"transforms":{"Better BibTeX metadata":[{"type":"Better BibTeX metadata","value":{"BetterBibTeX":"6.7.1"}}]},"objType":"Better BibLaTeX","dirty":true,"cachedIndex":null,"cachedBinaryIndex":null,"cachedData":null,"adaptiveBinaryIndices":false,"transactional":false,"cloneObjects":true,"cloneMethod":"parse-stringify","asyncListeners":false,"disableMeta":false,"disableChangesApi":true,"disableDeltaChangesApi":true,"autoupdate":false,"serializableIndices":true,"disableFreeze":true,"ttl":null,"maxId":231,"DynamicViews":[],"events":{"insert":[],"update":[],"pre-insert":[],"pre-update":[],"close":[],"flushbuffer":[],"error":[],"delete":[null],"warning":[null]},"changes":[],"dirtyIds":[]}
