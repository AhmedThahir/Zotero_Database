Injury incidence was monitored over one competitive season. Risk profiling was assessed using traditional regression analyses and compared to supervised machine learning algorithms constructed using decision trees.\nResults\nUsing continuous data, multivariate logistic analysis identified SLCMJ asymmetry as the sole significant predictor of injury (OR 0.94, 0.92–0.97, p<0.001), with a specificity of 97.7% and sensitivity of 15.2% giving an AUC of 0.661. The best performing decision tree model provided a specificity of 74.2% and sensitivity of 55.6% with an AUC of 0.663. All variables contributed to the final machine model, with asymmetry in the SLCMJ, 75%Hop and Y-balance, plus tuck jump knee valgus and anthropometrics being the most frequent contributors.\nConclusions\nAlthough both statistical methods reported similar accuracy, logistic regression provided very low sensitivity and only identified a single neuromuscular injury risk factor. The machine learning model provided much improved sensitivity to predict injury and identified interactions of asymmetry, knee valgus angle and body size as contributing factors to an injurious profile in youth football players.","date":"November 1, 2020","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1440244019316767","accessDate":"2021-12-21T07:35:09Z","volume":"23","pages":"1044-1048","publicationTitle":"Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsams.2020.04.021","issue":"11","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport","ISSN":"1440-2440","creators":[{"firstName":"Jon L.","lastName":"Oliver","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Ayala","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mark B.

Machine learning is being used in virtually all areas in one way or another, due to its extreme effectiveness. One such area where predictive systems have gained a lot of popularity is the prediction of football match results. This paper demonstrates our work on the building of a generalized predictive model for predicting the results of the English Premier League. Using feature engineering and exploratory data analysis, we create a feature set for determining the most important factors for predicting the results of a football match, and consequently create a highly accurate predictive system using machine learning. We demonstrate the strong dependence of our models’ performances on important features. Our best model using gradient boosting achieved a performance of 0.2156 on the ranked probability score (RPS) metric for game weeks 6 to 38 for the English Premier League aggregated over two seasons (2014–2015 and 2015–2016), whereas the betting organizations that we consider (Bet365 and Pinnacle Sports) obtained an RPS value of 0.2012 for the same period. Since a lower RPS value represents a higher predictive accuracy, our model was not able to outperform the bookmaker’s predictions, despite obtaining promising results.","date":"04/2019","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169207018300116","accessDate":"2022-02-12T17:14:26Z","volume":"35","pages":"741-755","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Forecasting","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijforecast.2018.01.003","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"International Journal of Forecasting","ISSN":"01692070","creators":[{"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Baboota","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Harleen","lastName":"Kaur","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["PU2D9LA7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-02-12T17:14:26Z","dateModified":"2022-02-12T17:14:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/2YIPJ82I","itemID":135,"attachments":[{"key":"J4FR9WBE","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Baboota and Kaur - 2019 - Predictive analysis and modelling football results.pdf","parentItem":"2YIPJ82I","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Baboota and Kaur - 2019 - Predictive analysis and modelling football results.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-02-12T17:14:16Z","dateModified":"2022-02-12T17:14:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/J4FR9WBE","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\J4FR9WBE\\Baboota and Kaur - 2019 - Predictive analysis and modelling football results.pdf","defaultPath":"files/134/Baboota and Kaur - 2019 - Predictive analysis and modelling football results.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229107964,"version":0},"$loki":116},{"itemID":523,"item":{"key":"3A5FAJ8C","version":0,"itemType":"blogPost","title":"Radix Sort","abstractNote":"A Computer Science portal for geeks.

The authors present upper bounds for both measures that are constructed using actual playing schedules. They model competitive balance as a function of player talent, the incidence of strikes, the expansion of the NFL, change in the number of playoff teams, schedule length, team relocation, the number of new stadiums, and the introduction of free agency and the salary cap in the NFL using data from the 1970 to 2002 seasons.

Soccer production, measured as league points per game, is modeled as a function of a team’s total wage bill, the distribution of the team’s wage bill, and goals per game. Both the Gini coefficient and the coefficient of variation are utilized to measure salary inequality. The results indicate that production in MLS is negatively responsive to increases in the salary inequality; the estimation model with the best fit uses the coefficient of variation to measure dispersion. Furthermore, MLS teams appear to be constrained in their choices of salary inequality by the salary cap and other regulations.","date":"10/2016","language":"en","shortTitle":"Superstar Salaries and Soccer Success","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1527002514547297","accessDate":"2022-04-16T17:52:30Z","volume":"17","pages":"716-735","publicationTitle":"Journal of Sports Economics","DOI":"10.1177/1527002514547297","issue":"7","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Sports Economics","ISSN":"1527-0025, 1552-7794","creators":[{"firstName":"Dennis","lastName":"Coates","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bernd","lastName":"Frick","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Todd","lastName":"Jewell","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["PU2D9LA7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-16T17:52:30Z","dateModified":"2022-04-16T17:52:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/3YAW8NBB","itemID":492,"attachments":[{"key":"UVXQH6RB","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Coates et al. - 2016 - Superstar Salaries and Soccer Success The Impact .pdf","parentItem":"3YAW8NBB","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Coates et al. - 2016 - Superstar Salaries and Soccer Success The Impact .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-16T17:52:25Z","dateModified":"2022-04-16T17:52:31Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/UVXQH6RB","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\UVXQH6RB\\Coates et al. - 2016 - Superstar Salaries and Soccer Success The Impact .pdf","defaultPath":"files/491/Coates et al. - 2016 - Superstar Salaries and Soccer Success The Impact .pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229107987,"version":0},"$loki":124},{"itemID":136,"item":{"key":"4FVDALLA","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Artificial intelligence for team sports: a survey","abstractNote":"Abstract\n            The sports domain presents a number of significant computational challenges for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). In this paper, we explore the techniques that have been applied to the challenges within team sports thus far. We focus on a number of different areas, namely match outcome prediction, tactical decision making, player investments, fantasy sports, and injury prediction. By assessing the work in these areas, we explore how AI is used to predict match outcomes and to help sports teams improve their strategic and tactical decision making. In particular, we describe the main directions in which research efforts have been focused to date. This highlights not only a number of strengths but also weaknesses of the models and techniques that have been employed. Finally, we discuss the research questions that exist in order to further the use of AI and ML in team sports.","date":"2019","language":"en","shortTitle":"Artificial intelligence for team sports","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0269888919000225/type/journal_article","accessDate":"2022-02-12T17:15:55Z","volume":"34","pages":"e28","publicationTitle":"The Knowledge Engineering Review","DOI":"10.1017/S0269888919000225","journalAbbreviation":"The Knowledge Engineering Review","ISSN":"0269-8889, 1469-8005","creators":[{"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Beal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Timothy J.","lastName":"Norman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sarvapali D.","lastName":"Ramchurn","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["PU2D9LA7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-02-12T17:15:55Z","dateModified":"2022-02-12T17:15:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/4FVDALLA","itemID":136,"attachments":[{"key":"TNHASNFV","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Beal et al_2019_Artificial intelligence for team sports.pdf","url":"https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/436900/1/Artificial_Intelligence_for_Team_Sports_A_Survey.pdf","accessDate":"2022-02-12T17:15:59Z","parentItem":"4FVDALLA","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Beal et al_2019_Artificial intelligence for team sports.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-02-12T17:15:59Z","dateModified":"2022-02-12T17:15:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/TNHASNFV","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\TNHASNFV\\Beal et al_2019_Artificial intelligence for team sports.pdf","defaultPath":"files/137/Beal et al_2019_Artificial intelligence for team sports.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229107990,"version":0},"$loki":125},{"itemID":578,"item":{"key":"4NWQM4WV","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Mean_UNEMP_Level.xlsx","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","charset":"","filename":"Mean_UNEMP_Level.xlsx","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-22T07:42:34Z","dateModified":"2022-10-22T07:42:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/4NWQM4WV","itemID":578,"localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\4NWQM4WV\\Mean_UNEMP_Level.xlsx","defaultPath":"files/578/Mean_UNEMP_Level.xlsx"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229107991,"version":0},"$loki":126},{"itemID":489,"item":{"key":"5C2M5FY4","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Can sporting success in Norwegian football be predicted from budgeted revenues?","abstractNote":"Research question: Although previous research has shown that there is an association between ﬁnancial strength and sporting outcome, whereby teams with larger budgeted revenues typically perform better in sports than other teams, this was not supported by a newspaper article describing the 2012 season in Norwegian football.

This in-depth analysis highlights the power of Instagram storytelling tactics in driving conversions and website traffic for content marketers, exemplified by the successes of global media brands such as the Guardian and Vice. This article explains how both the Guardian and Vice reformat their on-site content offering for mobile to appeal to their Instagram audiences, and also publish episodic series to attract new and existing audiences into regularly ‘tuning in’ to their content in a bid to boost on-platform engagement and on-site traffic. From these strategies, the Guardian has grown 79 per cent in Instagram followers in 12 months, while Vice’s Instagram Stories now sit at a 50 per cent retention rate. Additionally, this article emphasises the effectiveness of combining content strategies with social media strategies, and why it is imperative to be able to distinguish the differences between the two.

It is conventionally the case that defence and attack capabilities have been assumed to be constant during a match and estimated against the average performance of all other teams in history. Drawing upon a Bayesian method, this paper proposes a dynamic strength model which relaxes assumption of the constant teams&rsquo; strengths and permits applying in-match performance information to calibrate them. An empirical study demonstrates that although the Bayesian model fails to achieve improvement in goal difference prediction, it registers clear achievements with regard to the prediction of the total number of goals and Win/Draw/Loss outcome prediction. When the Bayesian model bets against the SBOBet bookmaker, one of the most popular gaming companies among Asian handicaps fans, whose odds data were obtained from both the Win/Draw/Loss market and over&ndash;under market, it may obtain positive returns; this clearly contrasts with the process model with constant strengths, which fails to win money from the bookmaker.","date":"2020/1","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"www.mdpi.com","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/8/2904","accessDate":"2021-12-21T07:36:01Z","rights":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","extra":"Number: 8\nPublisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","volume":"10","pages":"2904","publicationTitle":"Applied Sciences","DOI":"10.3390/app10082904","issue":"8","creators":[{"firstName":"Qingrong","lastName":"Zou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Song","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Shi","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"adjusting forecast","type":1},{"tag":"association football","type":1},{"tag":"bayesian inference","type":1},{"tag":"betting market","type":1},{"tag":"in-play prediction","type":1},{"tag":"point process model","type":1}],"collections":["PU2D9LA7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-12-21T07:36:01Z","dateModified":"2021-12-21T07:36:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/7C2VAR7T","itemID":90,"attachments":[{"key":"TRUKAHHH","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Snapshot","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/8/2904","accessDate":"2021-12-21T07:36:09Z","parentItem":"7C2VAR7T","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2904.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-12-21T07:36:09Z","dateModified":"2021-12-21T07:36:09Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/TRUKAHHH","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\TRUKAHHH\\2904.html","defaultPath":"files/92/2904.html"},{"key":"ZSBIW4W2","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Zou et al_2020_A Bayesian In-Play Prediction Model for Association Football Outcomes.pdf","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/8/2904/pdf","accessDate":"2021-12-21T07:36:07Z","parentItem":"7C2VAR7T","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zou et al_2020_A Bayesian In-Play Prediction Model for Association Football Outcomes.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Since transformers are usually combined with estimators for preprocessing, using pipeline in scikit-learn can be really useful. To be precise, Pipelines sequentially apply a list of transformers and a final estimator. Therefore, the purpose of the pipeline is to assemble several steps that can be cross-validated while setting different parameters.

To answer this question, we develop LinNet (which stands for LINeup NETwork). LinNet exploits the dynamics of a directed network that captures the performance of lineups during their matchups. The nodes of this network represent the diﬀerent lineups, while an edge from node B to node A exists if lineup λA has outperformed lineup λB. We further annotate each edge with the corresponding performance margin (point margin per minute). We then utilize this structure to learn a set of latent features for each node (i.e., lineup) using the node2vec framework. Consequently, using the latent, learned features, LinNet builds a logistic regression model for the probability of lineup λA outperforming lineup λB. We evaluate the proposed method by using NBA lineup data from the ﬁve seasons between 2007-08 and 2011-12. Our results indicate that our method has an out-of-sample accuracy of 68%. In comparison, utilizing simple network centrality metrics (i.e., PageRank) achieves an accuracy of just 53%, while using the adjusted plus-minus of the players in the lineup for the same prediction problem provides an accuracy of only 55%. We have also explored the adjusted lineups’ plus-minus as our predictors and obtained an accuracy of 59%. Furthermore, the probability output of LinNet is well-calibrated as indicated by the Brier score and the reliability curve. One of the main beneﬁts of LinNet is its generic nature that allows it to be applied in diﬀerent sports since the only input required is the lineups’ matchup network, i.e., not any sport-speciﬁc features are needed.","date":"2019","language":"en","shortTitle":"LinNet","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-030-10997-4_2","accessDate":"2022-02-01T07:01:02Z","extra":"Series Title: Lecture Notes in Computer Science\nDOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-10997-4_2","volume":"11053","place":"Cham","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","ISBN":"978-3-030-10996-7 978-3-030-10997-4","pages":"20-36","bookTitle":"Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases","creators":[{"firstName":"Ulf","lastName":"Brefeld","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Edward","lastName":"Curry","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Elizabeth","lastName":"Daly","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"MacNamee","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Alice","lastName":"Marascu","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Pinelli","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Berlingerio","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Neil","lastName":"Hurley","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Pelechrinis","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["PU2D9LA7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-02-01T07:01:02Z","dateModified":"2022-02-06T20:11:20Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/85BFZZ9B","itemID":106,"attachments":[{"key":"9DJ54N3V","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Pelechrinis - 2019 - LinNet Probabilistic Lineup Evaluation Through Ne.pdf","url":"http://www.ecmlpkdd2018.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/35.pdf","accessDate":"2022-02-01T07:00:57Z","parentItem":"85BFZZ9B","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Pelechrinis - 2019 - LinNet Probabilistic Lineup Evaluation Through Ne.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-02-01T07:00:57Z","dateModified":"2022-02-01T07:01:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/9DJ54N3V","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\9DJ54N3V\\Pelechrinis - 2019 - LinNet Probabilistic Lineup Evaluation Through Ne.pdf","defaultPath":"files/105/Pelechrinis - 2019 - LinNet Probabilistic Lineup Evaluation Through Ne.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229108014,"version":0},"$loki":136},{"itemID":108,"item":{"key":"8IC7SCMN","version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Sports Analytics algorithms for performance prediction","abstractNote":"Common Machine Learning applications in sports analytics relate to player injury prediction and prevention, potential skill or market value evaluation, as well as team or player performance prediction.

On the one hand, playing football has become a high-income profession and the players are highly motivated; on the other hand, stronger teams have higher incomes and therefore afford better players leading to an even stronger appearance in tournaments that can make the game more imbalanced and hence predictable. To quantify and document this observation, in this work, we take a minimalist network science approach to measure the predictability of football over 26 years in major European leagues. We show that over time, the games in major leagues have indeed become more predictable. We provide further support for this observation by showing that inequality between teams has increased and the home-field advantage has been vanishing ubiquitously. We do not include any direct analysis on the effects of monetization on football’s predictability or therefore, lack of excitement; however, we propose several hypotheses which could be tested in future analyses.","libraryCatalog":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","url":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.210617","accessDate":"2021-12-21T07:20:23Z","extra":"Publisher: Royal Society","volume":"8","pages":"210617","publicationTitle":"Royal Society Open Science","DOI":"10.1098/rsos.210617","issue":"12","creators":[{"firstName":"Victor Martins","lastName":"Maimone","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Taha","lastName":"Yasseri","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"centrality","type":1},{"tag":"football","type":1},{"tag":"network","type":1},{"tag":"perdition","type":1}],"collections":["PU2D9LA7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-12-21T07:20:23Z","dateModified":"2021-12-21T07:20:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/8WVWDI3N","itemID":76,"attachments":[{"key":"S5AKQ8IQ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Maimone_Yasseri_Football is becoming more predictable;

It assesses whether entries into the penalty area are influenced by match status, a player’s dismissal and the respective quality of the competing teams. Two observers analysed the relation between defensive and offensive strategies and their scoring consequences for all 64 matches played in the 2006 World Cup. Kappa values ranged between 0.93 and 0.98 for intra-reliability and between 0.88 and 0.98 for inter-reliability. It was found that winning teams received significantly fewer entries into their own penalty area (mean 041.42, s 011.86) than drawing (mean 050.07, s014.75) and losing teams (mean 047.23, s 012.14). Teams that received more entries into their own penalty area than the opposing team were significantly more likely to concede a goal (P B 0.001). Teams losing by one (mean 00.41, s00.21), two (mean 00.42, s00.26) or more than two goals (mean 00.34, s 00.13) received significantly fewer entries into the penalty area per minute than teams winning by one (mean 00.55, s00.27) or two goals (mean 00.59, s 00.39). Teams with fewer players on the pitch received significantly more entries into the penalty area per minute than teams with more (mean 00.22, s 00.07) or the same number (mean 00.14, s00.05) of players. Based on these results, it is suggested that teams should enter the opposing team’s penalty area but should not allow their opponents to do the same. These results also highlight the significance of the dismissal of a player.","date":"05/2013","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17461391.2011.606834","accessDate":"2022-04-09T13:26:00Z","volume":"13","pages":"241-248","publicationTitle":"European Journal of Sport Science","DOI":"10.1080/17461391.2011.606834","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"European Journal of Sport Science","ISSN":"1746-1391, 1536-7290","creators":[{"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Ruiz-Ruiz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Fradua","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ángel","lastName":"Fernández-GarcÍa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Asier","lastName":"Zubillaga","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["PU2D9LA7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-09T13:26:00Z","dateModified":"2022-04-09T13:26:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/AYY5KTVL","itemID":440,"attachments":[{"key":"5TFHY2UH","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Ruiz-Ruiz et al. - 2013 - Analysis of entries into the penalty area as a per.pdf","url":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17461391.2011.606834?needAccess=true","accessDate":"2022-04-09T13:25:56Z","parentItem":"AYY5KTVL","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ruiz-Ruiz et al. - 2013 - Analysis of entries into the penalty area as a per.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-09T13:25:56Z","dateModified":"2022-04-09T13:26:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/5TFHY2UH","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\5TFHY2UH\\Ruiz-Ruiz et al. - 2013 - Analysis of entries into the penalty area as a per.pdf","defaultPath":"files/439/Ruiz-Ruiz et al. - 2013 - Analysis of entries into the penalty area as a per.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229108050,"version":0},"$loki":147},{"itemID":158,"item":{"key":"B929N6J7","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Prediction Model of Football World Cup Championship Based on Machine Learning and Mobile Algorithm","abstractNote":"With the technological development and change of the times in the current era, with the rapid development of science and technology and information technology, there is a gradual replacement in the traditional way of cognition.

The main goal of this article is to use machine learning technology; this article defines the main prediction model by python programming language, analyzes and forecasts the data of previous World Cup, and establishes the analysis and prediction model of football field by K-mean and DPC clustering algorithm. Python programming is used to implement the algorithm. The data of the previous World Cup football matches are selected, and the built model is used for the predictive analysis on the Python platform; the calculation method based on the DPC-K-means algorithm is used to determine the accuracy and probability of the variables through the calculation results, which develops results in specific competitions. Research shows how the machine wins and learns the efficiency of the production process, and the machine learning process, the reliability, and accuracy of the prediction results are improved by more than 55%, which proves that mobile algorithm technology has a high level of predictive analysis on the World Cup football stadium.","date":"2021-9-13","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/misy/2021/1875060/","accessDate":"2022-02-12T19:50:51Z","volume":"2021","pages":"1-11","publicationTitle":"Mobile Information Systems","DOI":"10.1155/2021/1875060","journalAbbreviation":"Mobile Information Systems","ISSN":"1875-905X, 1574-017X","creators":[{"firstName":"Yanyang","lastName":"Bai","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xuesheng","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sang-Bing","lastName":"Tsai","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[],"collections":["PU2D9LA7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-02-12T19:50:51Z","dateModified":"2022-02-12T19:50:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/B929N6J7","itemID":158,"attachments":[{"key":"DGLMHN2C","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Bai and Zhang - 2021 - Prediction Model of Football World Cup Championshi.pdf","url":"https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/misy/2021/1875060.pdf","accessDate":"2022-02-12T19:50:46Z","parentItem":"B929N6J7","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Bai and Zhang - 2021 - Prediction Model of Football World Cup Championshi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-02-12T19:50:46Z","dateModified":"2022-02-12T19:50:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/DGLMHN2C","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\DGLMHN2C\\Bai and Zhang - 2021 - Prediction Model of Football World Cup Championshi.pdf","defaultPath":"files/157/Bai and Zhang - 2021 - Prediction Model of Football World Cup Championshi.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229108056,"version":0},"$loki":148},{"itemID":541,"item":{"key":"B9MYYMXL","version":0,"itemType":"blogPost","title":"Relational Model in DBMS","abstractNote":"Relational Model was proposed by E.F.

Most coaches have been affected, to a greater or lesser extent, by the tactics referred to as the ‘‘long-ball game’’ or ‘‘direct play’’, which was a tactic employed as a consequence of this research. Data from these studies, published in the late 1960s, have been reconﬁrmed by analyses of different FIFA World Cup tournaments by several different research groups. In the present study, the number of passes that led to goals scored in two FIFA World Cup ﬁnals were analysed. The results conform to that of previous research, but when these data were normalized with respect to the frequency of the respective lengths of passing sequences, there were more goals scored from longer passing sequences than from shorter passing sequences. Teams produced signiﬁcantly more shots per possession for these longer passing sequences, but the strike ratio of goals from shots is better for ‘‘direct play’’ than for ‘‘possession play’’. Finally, an analysis of the shooting data for successful and unsuccessful teams for different lengths of passing sequences in the 1990 FIFA World Cup ﬁnals indicated that, for successful teams, longer passing sequences produced more goals per possession than shorter passing sequences. For unsuccessful teams, neither tactic had a clear advantage.

This paper reviews background and advanced basketball metrics used in National Basketball Association (NBA) and Euroleague games. The purpose of this paper is to benchmark existing performance analytics used in the literature for evaluating teams and players. Basketball is a sport that requires full set enumeration of parameters in order to understand the game in depth and analyze the strategy and decisions by minimizing unpredictability. This research provides valuable information for team and player performance basketball analytics to be used for better understanding of the game. Furthermore, these analytics can be used for team composition, athlete career improvement and assessing how this could be materialized for future predictions. Hence, critical analysis of these metrics are valuable tools for domain experts and decision makers to understand the strengths and weaknesses in the game, to better evaluate opponent teams, to see how to optimize performance indicators, to use them for team and player forecasting and finally to make better choices for team composition.","date":"November 1, 2020","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306437920300557","accessDate":"2021-12-21T07:41:10Z","volume":"93","pages":"101562","publicationTitle":"Information Systems","DOI":"10.1016/j.is.2020.101562","journalAbbreviation":"Information Systems","ISSN":"0306-4379","creators":[{"firstName":"Vangelis","lastName":"Sarlis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Tjortjis","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Business intelligence","type":1},{"tag":"Data analysis","type":1},{"tag":"Machine learning","type":1},{"tag":"Sports analytics","type":1},{"tag":"Sports Data Mining (DM)","type":1},{"tag":"Statistics","type":1}],"collections":["PU2D9LA7"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/ASU86AEQ"]},"dateAdded":"2021-12-21T07:41:10Z","dateModified":"2022-02-06T20:13:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/JKI2WX5G","itemID":94,"attachments":[{"key":"LBEYVVFH","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Sarlis and Tjortjis - 2020 - Sports analytics — Evaluation of basketball player.pdf","url":"https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/271528/1-s2.0-S0306437920X00056/1-s2.0-S0306437920300557/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEBcaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIH14tcYG5aoLVLjF8JAOvcTYVkNSBy7BvlG2fmu0ZFugAiEA0MiL3xWT8UzzcdGAHDUlK%2BAuUT2FP%2BZ9vXwusvn15yQq%2BgMIEBAEGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDPFtNR92liJEarqLLSrXAyAuTp%2BgP7DO4HsO46grwRVhCjxdcyY313Odg%2B50FGJnHjpMVrSv7H%2FtwPb4YXEgsOo%2FQDy9bE7Mn8M0NqR6CBMJbVf0Dc6B3%2FUhPBh27%2FMHN6YUNUyJStEwYcB0kpi2A2JQscYOnA7bSyqSIRktrqNLDiOMeRDmLFxmNqDP6uDEl%2FhHopUKupUfYQt7MpP8JKPFc%2FMpPBmNPKRx86n%2FSF8XUdM%2BxlCssoMOkP0dmTxG1wwugdKHTSq%2B0TpeBYQRHgW0JWBmMdxHviZyPyJRYU9zXt514Gpwe3E3vLCbZq5N%2BHXh1P6XFLdH9WmWAC6q0mBRPCQQM5g2xJR400kDm0jQZ%2Bo81%2BNmV59UaNCBOMN%2BhsWg6KkwrfWsFREcJw08%2BdddtPK2mU61PRmOvgFs0117XXwFafwueCjiv%2BWBRVPgIIBEzq36OSeWUlbUCylodz0nPr4BBDS28iczlPeSF13DtLKX4679GD%2FtJd6a3p5C3ZNwHtw2zNcbJqAUCLSotCSBH4H%2Br2DdwFZVZylvH5Zpo52Ixua8L1BUE4YkG3amgRrqF3vSdqPw94oyCyUZD4UG4dE97QbDAEljx3m%2BbCM7WbVjOrsN45OyPi8NMHqUuN%2FMzrKrpjCK9YWOBjqlAcKgPPlGggxSOr%2F0AXU1MikiZN0Yu1Rfv33SVjc%2BwX247S5NHlZvmHIbb2C1465cq8Rc%2BkNdbr4Vc3n%2BQjZAvra%2Fmq9%2F%2FtFzRTbbGjgN1XfcJTq6ZiIOlDhfRCfvO6F95%2BiHMBj8H%2FXWbsKtZqOSepKrCStw8qrxFmRrS%2B3WHpJD2ukivuFZMOsXabFl8ASa%2BvkZdyMU095M%2BisQXvChnJTBebugrA%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20211221T074115Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTY2WH7YF23%2F20211221%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=5abc74457456dc3f8e512c48d977650a662f6d9de4d69b6d51b31221564fc7d7&hash=f2d232c0cfacc1bc70c8eb7b7873283670f5f3bf88987e0b624fc4d65dc14f3b&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S0306437920300557&tid=spdf-bd162167-bc0c-478e-9573-8fda4a1ffefa&sid=096214032a8d63489198be9-39281b96bdfcgxrqb&type=client","accessDate":"2021-12-21T07:41:28Z","parentItem":"JKI2WX5G","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Sarlis and Tjortjis - 2020 - Sports analytics — Evaluation of basketball player.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-12-21T07:41:28Z","dateModified":"2021-12-21T07:42:17Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/LBEYVVFH","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\LBEYVVFH\\Sarlis and Tjortjis - 2020 - Sports analytics — Evaluation of basketball player.pdf","defaultPath":"files/95/Sarlis and Tjortjis - 2020 - Sports analytics — Evaluation of basketball player.pdf"}],"notes":[{"key":"JT2QZKZH","version":0,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"JKI2WX5G","note":"<p><strong>Extracted Annotations (2/12/2022, 9:25:49 PM)</strong></p>\n<p>\"The purpose of this paper is to benchmark existing performance analytics used in the literature for evaluating teams and players.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LBEYVVFH?page=1\">Sarlis and Tjortjis 2020:101562</a>)</p>\n<p>\"these analytics can be used for team composition, athlete career improvement and assessing how this could be materialized for future predictions.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LBEYVVFH?page=1\">Sarlis and Tjortjis 2020:101562</a>)</p>\n<p>\"to understand the strengths and weaknesses in the game, to better evaluate opponent teams, to see how to optimize performance indicators, to use them for team and player forecasting and finally to make better choices for team composition\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LBEYVVFH?page=1\">Sarlis and Tjortjis 2020:101562</a>)</p>\n<p>\"sports data are irregular and sparse.

However, such a study has not been conducted in football (soccer) so far. The purpose of this research was to study whether data mined from Twitter can be used for this purpose. We built a set of predictive models for the outcome of football games of the English Premier League for a 3 month period based on tweets and we studied whether these models can overcome predictive models which use only historical data and simple football statistics. Moreover, combined models are constructed using both Twitter and historical data. The final results indicate that data mined from Twitter can indeed be a useful source for predicting games in the Premier League. The final Twitter-based model performs singificantly better than chance when measured by Cohen’s kappa and is comparable to the model that uses simple statistics and historical data. Combining both models raises the performance higher than it was achieved by each individual model. Thereby, this study provides evidence that Twitter derived features can indeed provide useful information for the prediction of football (soccer) outcomes.","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","pages":"10","creators":[{"firstName":"Stylianos","lastName":"Kampakis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Adamides","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["PU2D9LA7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-09T13:10:46Z","dateModified":"2022-04-09T13:10:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/LNKZPYYK","itemID":434,"attachments":[{"key":"8RXE854M","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Kampakis and Adamides - Using Twitter to predict football outcomes.pdf","url":"https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1411/1411.1243.pdf","accessDate":"2022-04-09T13:10:44Z","parentItem":"LNKZPYYK","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kampakis and Adamides - Using Twitter to predict football outcomes.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-09T13:10:44Z","dateModified":"2022-04-09T13:10:47Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/8RXE854M","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\8RXE854M\\Kampakis and Adamides - Using Twitter to predict football outcomes.pdf","defaultPath":"files/433/Kampakis and Adamides - Using Twitter to predict football outcomes.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229108118,"version":0},"$loki":180},{"itemID":121,"item":{"key":"MBP8TTUB","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Instagram_ Instagram Blackbook_ Everything You Need To Know About Instagram For Business and Personal - Ultimate Instagram Marketing Book (Internet Marketing, Social Media).pdf","url":"http://dspace.vnbrims.org:13000/jspui/bitstream/123456789/4939/1/Instagram_%20Instagram%20Blackbook_%20Everything%20You%20Need%20To%20Know%20About%20Instagram%20For%20Business%20and%20Personal%20-%20Ultimate%20Instagram%20Marketing%20Book%20%28Internet%20Marketing%2C%20Social%20Media%29.pdf","accessDate":"2022-02-11T06:08:41Z","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Instagram_ Instagram Blackbook_ Everything You Need To Know About Instagram For Business and Personal - Ultimate Instagram Marketing Book (Internet Marketing, Social Media).pdf","tags":[],"collections":["RKAVMS45"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-02-11T06:08:41Z","dateModified":"2022-02-11T06:08:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/MBP8TTUB","itemID":121,"localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\MBP8TTUB\\Instagram_ Instagram Blackbook_ Everything You Need To Know About Instagram For Business and Personal - Ultimate Instagram Marketing Book (Internet Marketing, Social Media).pdf","defaultPath":"files/121/Instagram_ Instagram Blackbook_ Everything You Need To Know About Instagram For Business and Personal - Ultimate Instagram Marketing Book (Internet Marketing, Social Media).pdf"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229108120,"version":0},"$loki":181},{"itemID":93,"item":{"key":"MMNC8CZF","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Characteristics and optimization of core local network: Big data analysis of football matches","abstractNote":"The current study constructed social network using player positions and passing process based on available literature.

At the team level, we discuss methods for characterizing team strategy and performance, while at the player level, we take a deep look into a myriad of tools for player evaluation. This includes metrics for overall player value, defensive ability, and shot modeling, and methods for understanding performance over multiple seasons via player production curves.

A Machine Learning Approach to Supporting Football Team Building and Transfers","abstractNote":"Background: the machine learning (ML) techniques have been implemented in numerous applications, including health-care, security, entertainment, and sports. In this article, we present how the ML can be used for building a professional football team and planning player transfers. Methods: in this research, we deﬁned numerous parameters for player assessment, and three deﬁnitions of a successful transfer. We used the Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and AdaBoost algorithms in order to predict the player transfer success. We used realistic, publicly available data in order to train and test the classiﬁers. Results: in the article, we present numerous experiments; they differ in the weights of parameters, the successful transfer deﬁnitions, and other factors. We report promising results (accuracy = 0.82, precision = 0.84, recall = 0.82, and F1-score = 0.83). Conclusion: the presented research proves that machine learning can be helpful in professional football team building. The proposed algorithm will be developed in the future and it may be implemented as a professional tool for football talent scouts.","date":"2021-01-10","language":"en","shortTitle":"Who Will Score?","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/1/90","accessDate":"2022-02-12T17:11:24Z","volume":"23","pages":"90","publicationTitle":"Entropy","DOI":"10.3390/e23010090","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Entropy","ISSN":"1099-4300","creators":[{"firstName":"Bartosz","lastName":"Ćwiklinski","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Agata","lastName":"Giełczyk","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michał","lastName":"Choraś","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["PU2D9LA7"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/PPCSW9C8","http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/QJSAPSSV"]},"dateAdded":"2022-02-12T17:11:24Z","dateModified":"2022-02-12T18:38:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/NUBLJQIG","itemID":129,"attachments":[{"key":"GRNNCS89","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Ćwiklinski et al. - 2021 - Who Will Score A Machine Learning Approach to Sup.pdf","parentItem":"NUBLJQIG","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ćwiklinski et al. - 2021 - Who Will Score A Machine Learning Approach to Sup.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-02-12T17:11:19Z","dateModified":"2022-02-12T17:11:24Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/GRNNCS89","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\GRNNCS89\\Ćwiklinski et al. - 2021 - Who Will Score A Machine Learning Approach to Sup.pdf","defaultPath":"files/128/Ćwiklinski et al. - 2021 - Who Will Score A Machine Learning Approach to Sup.pdf"},{"key":"XJRMG5ZT","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Ćwiklinski et al. - 2021 - Who Will Score A Machine Learning Approach to Sup.pdf","parentItem":"NUBLJQIG","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ćwiklinski et al. - 2021 - Who Will Score A Machine Learning Approach to Sup.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-02-12T17:12:13Z","dateModified":"2022-02-12T17:12:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/XJRMG5ZT","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\XJRMG5ZT\\Ćwiklinski et al. - 2021 - Who Will Score A Machine Learning Approach to Sup.pdf","defaultPath":"files/131/Ćwiklinski et al. - 2021 - Who Will Score A Machine Learning Approach to Sup.pdf"},{"key":"UMQWM7LD","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Ćwiklinski et al. - 2021 - Who Will Score A Machine Learning Approach to Sup.pdf","url":"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6aa9/97a80666e6c6aefaa3afb5f4c0e1122380bf.pdf","accessDate":"2022-02-12T17:16:56Z","parentItem":"NUBLJQIG","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ćwiklinski et al. - 2021 - Who Will Score A Machine Learning Approach to Sup.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-02-12T17:16:56Z","dateModified":"2022-02-12T18:38:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/UMQWM7LD","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\UMQWM7LD\\Ćwiklinski et al. - 2021 - Who Will Score A Machine Learning Approach to Sup.pdf","defaultPath":"files/138/Ćwiklinski et al. - 2021 - Who Will Score A Machine Learning Approach to Sup.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229108135,"version":0},"$loki":188},{"itemID":521,"item":{"key":"P5L9LUAJ","version":0,"itemType":"webpage","title":"Java Tutorial","abstractNote":"W3Schools offers free online tutorials, references and exercises in all the major languages of the web.

Using machine learning algorithms predicting the results of a football match, we obtained and create set of features, thus developing with high accurate predictive method using machine learning techniques.","date":"2021","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","volume":"08","pages":"9","issue":"03","creators":[{"firstName":"F Allwin","lastName":"Edilbert","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Iwin Thanakumar","lastName":"Joseph","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["PU2D9LA7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-02-12T17:51:06Z","dateModified":"2022-02-12T17:51:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/PW53EP7X","itemID":143,"attachments":[{"key":"9WTU9PZ5","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Edilbert and Joseph - 2021 - Survey on Predicting the Winning Football Team usi.pdf","url":"https://www.irjet.net/archives/V8/i3/IRJET-V8I3366.pdf","accessDate":"2022-02-12T17:51:03Z","parentItem":"PW53EP7X","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Edilbert and Joseph - 2021 - Survey on Predicting the Winning Football Team usi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-02-12T17:51:03Z","dateModified":"2022-02-12T17:51:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/9WTU9PZ5","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\9WTU9PZ5\\Edilbert and Joseph - 2021 - Survey on Predicting the Winning Football Team usi.pdf","defaultPath":"files/142/Edilbert and Joseph - 2021 - Survey on Predicting the Winning Football Team usi.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229108142,"version":0},"$loki":193},{"itemID":127,"item":{"key":"Q4RS4IJ8","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Application of Artificial Intelligence in Basketball Sport","abstractNote":"Basketball is among the most popular sports in the world, and its related industries have also produced huge economic benefits. In recent years, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in basketball has attracted a large amount of attention. We conducted a comprehensive review of the application research of AI in basketball through literature retrieval. Current research focuses on the AI analysis of basketball team and player performance, prediction of competition results, analysis and prediction of shooting, AI coaching system, intelligent training machine and arena, and sports injury prevention. Most studies have shown that AI technology can improve the training level of basketball players, help coaches formulate suitable game strategies, prevent sports injuries, and improve the enjoyment of games. At the same time, it is also found that the number and level of published papers are relatively limited. We believe that the application of AI in basketball is still in its infancy. We call on relevant industries to increase their research investment in this area, and promote the improvement of the level of basketball, making the game increasingly exciting as its worldwide popularity continues to increase.","date":"2021-07-08","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://apcz.umk.pl/JEHS/article/view/JEHS.2021.11.07.005","accessDate":"2022-02-12T17:10:07Z","volume":"11","pages":"54-67","publicationTitle":"Journal of Education, Health and Sport","DOI":"10.12775/JEHS.2021.11.07.005","issue":"7","journalAbbreviation":"J Educ Health Sport","ISSN":"2391-8306","creators":[{"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xinyang","lastName":"Xu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["PU2D9LA7"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/5GFL2BW5"]},"dateAdded":"2022-02-12T17:10:07Z","dateModified":"2022-02-12T17:12:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/Q4RS4IJ8","itemID":127,"attachments":[{"key":"CCXY3WG9","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Li and Xu - 2021 - Application of Artificial Intelligence in Basketba.pdf","parentItem":"Q4RS4IJ8","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Li and Xu - 2021 - Application of Artificial Intelligence in Basketba.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-02-12T17:10:02Z","dateModified":"2022-02-12T17:10:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/CCXY3WG9","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\CCXY3WG9\\Li and Xu - 2021 - Application of Artificial Intelligence in Basketba.pdf","defaultPath":"files/126/Li and Xu - 2021 - Application of Artificial Intelligence in Basketba.pdf"},{"key":"6QRED5VY","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Li and Xu - 2021 - Application of Artificial Intelligence in Basketba.pdf","parentItem":"Q4RS4IJ8","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Li and Xu - 2021 - Application of Artificial Intelligence in Basketba.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-02-12T17:12:11Z","dateModified":"2022-02-12T17:12:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/6QRED5VY","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\6QRED5VY\\Li and Xu - 2021 - Application of Artificial Intelligence in Basketba.pdf","defaultPath":"files/130/Li and Xu - 2021 - Application of Artificial Intelligence in Basketba.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229108145,"version":0},"$loki":194},{"itemID":500,"item":{"key":"QAQ7GNFX","version":0,"itemType":"computerProgram","title":"gini","abstractNote":"Calculate the Gini coefficient of a numpy array.","date":"2022-04-15T19:45:51Z","libraryCatalog":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/oliviaguest/gini","accessDate":"2022-04-17T07:15:48Z","extra":"original-date: 2016-07-29T12:58:30Z","programmingLanguage":"Python","creators":[{"firstName":"Olivia","lastName":"Guest","creatorType":"programmer"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZGY3GDTC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-17T07:15:48Z","dateModified":"2022-04-17T07:15:52Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/QAQ7GNFX","itemID":500,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229108157,"version":0},"$loki":195},{"itemID":600,"item":{"key":"QGRK9H2A","version":0,"itemType":"bookSection","title":"Football Player Value Assessment Using Machine Learning Techniques","abstractNote":"Sports analytics is a ﬁeld that is growing in popularity and application throughout the world.

The proposed models will mainly be based on the intrinsic features of the individual players which are provided in Football Manager video game. To do this, based on the individual statistics of 5316 players who are active in 11 different major leagues from Europe and South America, different value assessment models are conducted using advanced supervised learning techniques like ridge and lasso regressions, random forests and extreme gradient boosting. All the models have been built in R programming language. The performances of the models are compared based on their mean squared errors.

This paper reviews the literature to identify important attributes correlated with injuries and attempts to quantify their impact on player and team performance, using analytics in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 2010 up to 2020. It also provides an overview of Machine Learning (ML) and DS techniques and algorithms used to study injuries. Additionally, it provides information for coaches, sports and health scientists, managers and decision makers to recognize the most common injuries and investigate possible injury patterns during competitions. We identify teams and players who suffered the most, and the type of injuries requiring more attention. We found a high impact from injuries and pathologies on performance; musculoskeletal impairments are the most common ones that lead to decreased performance. Finally, we conclude that there is a weak positive relationship between performance and injuries based on a holistic multivariate model that describes player and team performance.","date":"07/2021","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S030643792100020X","accessDate":"2022-02-12T17:08:16Z","volume":"99","pages":"101750","publicationTitle":"Information Systems","DOI":"10.1016/j.is.2021.101750","journalAbbreviation":"Information Systems","ISSN":"03064379","creators":[{"firstName":"Vangelis","lastName":"Sarlis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vasilis","lastName":"Chatziilias","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Tjortjis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dimitris","lastName":"Mandalidis","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["PU2D9LA7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-02-12T17:08:16Z","dateModified":"2022-02-12T17:08:17Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/QMTERGDQ","itemID":123,"attachments":[{"key":"F379LDML","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Sarlis et al. - 2021 - A Data Science approach analysing the Impact of In.pdf","url":"https://thenbsca.com/media/A-data-science-approach-analyzing-the-impact-of-injuries-on-basketball-player-and-team-performance.pdf","accessDate":"2022-02-12T17:08:12Z","parentItem":"QMTERGDQ","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Sarlis et al. - 2021 - A Data Science approach analysing the Impact of In.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-02-12T17:08:12Z","dateModified":"2022-02-12T17:08:17Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/F379LDML","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\F379LDML\\Sarlis et al. - 2021 - A Data Science approach analysing the Impact of In.pdf","defaultPath":"files/122/Sarlis et al. - 2021 - A Data Science approach analysing the Impact of In.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229108168,"version":0},"$loki":198},{"itemID":97,"item":{"key":"QV8AS3CU","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Sports Analytics Algorithms for Performance Prediction","abstractNote":"Sports Analytics is not a new idea, but the way it is implemented nowadays have brought a revolution in the way teams, players, coaches, general managers but also reporters, betting agents and simple fans look at statistics and at sports.

Which of course integrates to x^3/3.\n\nNow lets create a function with two variables. x^2 and y^2. We can integrate this in terms of y and we can integrate this in terms of x. \n\nNow lets say we want to do a double integral of dx then dy.\n\nWe just nest the intergral function. And if we want to see any of these integrals evaluated we just need to put in a tuple with the lower and upper bounds. \n\nAnd lastly, if we want to see exactly what we are integrating we can change it to Integral with a capital I. Here is the outside integral.\n\nAnd if we want to see the double integral we can do that as well.\n\nThere you have it that is how you can use python to compute integrals    symbolically with sympy. \n\nPlease check out some of my other python videos and don’t forget to subscribe. :D\n\n\nThis is a Python anaconda tutorial for help with coding, programming,  or computer science.

Various team parameters were compared between the winning and losing teams in the 118 non-drawing matches. The results support the conclusions of our earlier analysis (Yue, Broich, & Mester, 2014) that the quality of shots, represented by the goal efficiency, defined by the number of goals divided by the number of shots, is more important than the quantity of shots for winning a soccer game. This conclusion is also confirmed by the correlation analysis based on all the 153 matches: The correlation between the number of goals and the goal efficiency is found to be much stronger than the correlation between the number of goals and the number of shots. The team parameters of the second to the fourth importance are the number of shots, the number of passes and the number of ball contacts respectively. In contrast, the distance coverage is found to be statistically not important for winning a game.","date":"2014","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","pages":"8","creators":[{"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Broich","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joachim","lastName":"Mester","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Seifriz","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["PU2D9LA7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-09T13:20:44Z","dateModified":"2022-04-09T13:20:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/TBA4HPVE","itemID":438,"attachments":[{"key":"KMDD29XN","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Broich et al. - 2014 - Statistical Analysis for the First Bundesliga in t.pdf","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/236301463.pdf","accessDate":"2022-04-09T13:19:35Z","parentItem":"TBA4HPVE","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Broich et al. - 2014 - Statistical Analysis for the First Bundesliga in t.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-09T13:19:35Z","dateModified":"2022-04-09T13:20:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/KMDD29XN","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\KMDD29XN\\Broich et al. - 2014 - Statistical Analysis for the First Bundesliga in t.pdf","defaultPath":"files/437/Broich et al. - 2014 - Statistical Analysis for the First Bundesliga in t.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229108193,"version":0},"$loki":209},{"itemID":469,"item":{"key":"TPY2PJ8U","version":0,"itemType":"videoRecording","title":"Solving Differential Equations In Python In Less Than 5 Minutes (General Solution)","abstractNote":"In this video I show you how to solve for the general solution to a differential equation using the sympy module in python.","date":"2018-06-15","libraryCatalog":"YouTube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkifb6nytao","accessDate":"2022-04-15T13:36:58Z","runningTime":"4:16","creators":[{"name":"Andrew Dotson","creatorType":"director"}],"tags":[],"collections":["F8SVX6FH"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-15T13:36:58Z","dateModified":"2022-04-15T13:36:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/TPY2PJ8U","itemID":469,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229108194,"version":0},"$loki":210},{"itemID":451,"item":{"key":"TQ5BVIF3","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"DIFFERENCES IN OFFENSIVE ACTIONS BETWEEN TOP AND LAST TEAMS IN GREEK FIRST SOCCER DIVISION.

The data set includes the unemployment rate and 36 explanatory variables, as suggested by theory and the relevant literature, spanning the period from 1998:4 to 2019:9 in monthly frequency. These variables are fed to three machine learning methodologies: Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), while an Elastic-Net Logistic Regression (Logit) model is used from the area of Econometrics. The results show that the optimal random forest model outperforms the other models by reaching a full-dataset forecasting accuracy of 88.5% and 85.4% on the out-of-sample.","date":"04/2022","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/for.2824","accessDate":"2022-09-24T06:31:06Z","volume":"41","pages":"551-566","publicationTitle":"Journal of Forecasting","DOI":"10.1002/for.2824","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Forecasting","ISSN":"0277-6693, 1099-131X","creators":[{"firstName":"Periklis","lastName":"Gogas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Theophilos","lastName":"Papadimitriou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Emmanouil","lastName":"Sofianos","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["4G8482A7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-24T06:31:06Z","dateModified":"2022-09-24T06:31:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/X8INGRI3","itemID":576,"attachments":[{"key":"2MB3396D","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Gogas et al. - 2022 - Forecasting unemployment in the euro area with mac.pdf","parentItem":"X8INGRI3","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gogas et al. - 2022 - Forecasting unemployment in the euro area with mac.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-24T06:31:01Z","dateModified":"2022-09-24T06:31:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/2MB3396D","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\2MB3396D\\Gogas et al. - 2022 - Forecasting unemployment in the euro area with mac.pdf","defaultPath":"files/575/Gogas et al. - 2022 - Forecasting unemployment in the euro area with mac.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229108220,"version":0},"$loki":220},{"itemID":125,"item":{"key":"YAFLN9DD","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Sports analytics and the big-data era","abstractNote":"The explosion of data, with large datasets that are available for analysis, has affected virtually every aspect of our lives.

Furthermore, they examined the differences between wide and short range results by ANOVA analyses and post hoc Tukey’s comparisons. The results showed that in wide range results (≥3 difference), the winners perform significant higher performance than the losers in the following factors: aerial duels (p< .10), overall duels (p< .10), ball possession (p< .05), overall passes (p< .05), opponent-half passing accuracy (p< .05), overall shots (p< .001), shot accuracy (p< .10), on-target shots (p< .001), short distance (p< .001) and long distance shots (p< .05), as well corners (p< .05).

We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.","date":"2016-08-13","language":"en","shortTitle":"XGBoost","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2939672.2939785","accessDate":"2022-12-04T15:08:40Z","place":"San Francisco California USA","publisher":"ACM","ISBN":"978-1-4503-4232-2","pages":"785-794","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","conferenceName":"KDD '16: The 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","DOI":"10.1145/2939672.2939785","creators":[{"firstName":"Tianqi","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Guestrin","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["P5YTHZWU"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-12-04T15:08:40Z","dateModified":"2022-12-04T15:08:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/YY55MRKP","itemID":597,"attachments":[{"key":"YSZTL8QX","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Chen and Guestrin - 2016 - XGBoost A Scalable Tree Boosting System.pdf","url":"https://dmlc.cs.washington.edu/data/pdf/XGBoostArxiv.pdf","accessDate":"2022-12-04T15:08:27Z","parentItem":"YY55MRKP","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Chen and Guestrin - 2016 - XGBoost A Scalable Tree Boosting System.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-12-04T15:08:27Z","dateModified":"2022-12-04T15:08:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/YSZTL8QX","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\YSZTL8QX\\Chen and Guestrin - 2016 - XGBoost A Scalable Tree Boosting System.pdf","defaultPath":"files/596/Chen and Guestrin - 2016 - XGBoost A Scalable Tree Boosting System.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229108232,"version":0},"$loki":225},{"itemID":472,"item":{"key":"YYQCPJAC","version":0,"itemType":"videoRecording","title":"Hanan Shteingart: Causality in Python","abstractNote":"Session language – English \nTarget audience – Data Scientists, Managers \nOther (target audience) – business analytics\n\nMost data scientists are focused on predictive (aka supervised) projects, yet the real growth is usually in the estimation of action effects and optimizations of action policies.

The performance of the players in the match affects the results of the game. Due to this it is very important to evaluate the player and know his weakness. Manual evaluation tends to generate many errors and take more time. In the current research the statistical model is proposed to predict the stats of the football player based on previous session data by considering various aspects of the game. Through literature reviews it is observed that machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be used predict the performance of football player. But which model would be more efficient considering the positions of the player is not considered in any article. The proposed model has designed separate model as per the position of the player during the game. This can help to predict the player's performance as per their playing position. The current study has successfully implemented various machine learning and deep learning models and provide comparative analysis of the same. Each position has considered different variables associated with that position. The performance of these models is compared for further clarification.","date":"2021-05","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","pages":"1-5","proceedingsTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference for Emerging Technology (INCET)","conferenceName":"2021 2nd International Conference for Emerging Technology (INCET)","DOI":"10.1109/INCET51464.2021.9456424","creators":[{"firstName":"S","lastName":"Manish.","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vandana","lastName":"Bhagat","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"RM","lastName":"Pramila","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Deep learning","type":1},{"tag":"Deep Learning Algorithm","type":1},{"tag":"Games","type":1},{"tag":"Machine Learning algorithm Linear Regression","type":1},{"tag":"Machine learning algorithms","type":1},{"tag":"Manuals","type":1},{"tag":"Measurement","type":1},{"tag":"Neural networks","type":1},{"tag":"Performance Prediction","type":1},{"tag":"Support vector machines","type":1}],"collections":["PU2D9LA7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-12-21T07:25:54Z","dateModified":"2021-12-21T07:25:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/Z4GMQ4VB","itemID":83,"attachments":[{"key":"TDKY5DV3","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"IEEE Xplore Abstract Record","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9456424","accessDate":"2021-12-21T07:26:08Z","parentItem":"Z4GMQ4VB","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"9456424.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-12-21T07:26:08Z","dateModified":"2021-12-21T07:26:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/TDKY5DV3","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\TDKY5DV3\\9456424.html","defaultPath":"files/84/9456424.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229108238,"version":0},"$loki":228},{"itemID":551,"item":{"key":"Z4WJNPA7","version":0,"itemType":"videoRecording","title":"Laplace Transforms with Sympy","abstractNote":"Laplace transforms with Sympy for symbolic math solutions.

This paper uses data on team payrolls in Major League Baseball between 1980 and 2000 to examine the link and implements Granger causality tests to establish whether the relationship runs from payroll to performance or vice versa. While there is no evidence that causality runs from payroll to performance over the entire sample period, the data shows that the cross section correlation between payroll and performance increased significantly in the 1990s. As a comparison, the paper examines the relationship between pay and performance in English soccer, and it is shown that Granger causality from higher payrolls to better performance cannot be rejected. We argue that this difference may be a consequence of the open market for player talent that obtains in soccer compared to the significant restrictions on trade that exist in Major League Baseball.","date":"05/2002","language":"en","shortTitle":"Testing Causality Between Team Performance and Payroll","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/152700250200300204","accessDate":"2022-04-16T18:10:41Z","volume":"3","pages":"149-168","publicationTitle":"Journal of Sports Economics","DOI":"10.1177/152700250200300204","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Sports Economics","ISSN":"1527-0025, 1552-7794","creators":[{"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Hall","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Szymanski","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrew S.","lastName":"Zimbalist","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["PU2D9LA7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-16T18:10:41Z","dateModified":"2022-04-16T18:10:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/ZBMYDXUI","itemID":497,"attachments":[{"key":"DY38CVPQ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Hall et al. - 2002 - Testing Causality Between Team Performance and Pay.pdf","parentItem":"ZBMYDXUI","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hall et al. - 2002 - Testing Causality Between Team Performance and Pay.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-16T18:10:36Z","dateModified":"2022-04-16T18:10:42Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/DY38CVPQ","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\DY38CVPQ\\Hall et al. - 2002 - Testing Causality Between Team Performance and Pay.pdf","defaultPath":"files/496/Hall et al. - 2002 - Testing Causality Between Team Performance and Pay.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229108241,"version":0},"$loki":230},{"itemID":518,"item":{"key":"ZCEQ7W9P","version":0,"itemType":"webpage","title":"Java Documentation - Get Started","url":"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/","accessDate":"2022-04-30T11:59:31Z","creators":[],"tags":[],"collections":["EKBERTGC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-30T11:59:31Z","dateModified":"2022-04-30T11:59:31Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/ZCEQ7W9P","itemID":518,"attachments":[{"key":"FIL77TEZ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Java Documentation - Get Started","url":"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/","accessDate":"2022-04-30T11:59:38Z","parentItem":"ZCEQ7W9P","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"java.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-04-30T11:59:38Z","dateModified":"2022-04-30T11:59:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/FIL77TEZ","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\FIL77TEZ\\java.html","defaultPath":"files/520/java.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229108243,"version":0},"$loki":231},{"itemID":555,"item":{"key":"ZDRBJ45B","version":0,"itemType":"forumPost","title":"Answer to \"How to group pandas DataFrame entries by date in a non-unique column\"","date":"2012-07-09","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/11397052","accessDate":"2022-05-17T04:43:07Z","forumTitle":"Stack Overflow","creators":[{"firstName":"Wes","lastName":"McKinney","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZGY3GDTC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-17T04:43:07Z","dateModified":"2022-05-17T04:43:18Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/ZDRBJ45B","itemID":555,"attachments":[{"key":"8LBR2BAZ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Snapshot","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11391969/how-to-group-pandas-dataframe-entries-by-date-in-a-non-unique-column","accessDate":"2022-05-17T04:43:15Z","parentItem":"ZDRBJ45B","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"how-to-group-pandas-dataframe-entries-by-date-in-a-non-unique-column.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-17T04:43:15Z","dateModified":"2022-05-17T04:43:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/ZEMTn0cy/items/8LBR2BAZ","localPath":"H:\\My Drive\\projects\\zotero\\storage\\8LBR2BAZ\\how-to-group-pandas-dataframe-entries-by-date-in-a-non-unique-column.html","defaultPath":"files/556/how-to-group-pandas-dataframe-entries-by-date-in-a-non-unique-column.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1679229108245,"version":0},"$loki":232},{"itemID":112,"item":{"key":"ZMZYGPNA","version":0,"itemType":"blogPost","title":"Correlation vs Causation: Understand the Difference for Your Product","abstractNote":"While causation and correlation can exist at the same time, correlation doesn't mean causation.
